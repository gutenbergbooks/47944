<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a><span class="smcap">Preface.</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME years ago, Professor J.&nbsp;K. Laughton&rsquo;s
admirable selection of &ldquo;Letters and Dispatches
of Horatio, Viscount Nelson,&rdquo;
inspired me with such an interest in Nelson&rsquo;s
wonderfully human and graphic correspondence
that I studied the larger and earlier &ldquo;Dispatches
and Letters of Lord Nelson,&rdquo; collected by Sir
Harris Nicolas. The present book is the
outcome of a long and affectionate study of
these two works, and the well-thumbed pages of
Southey and Jeaffreson.</p>

<p>But since, at the time of my first visit to Sicily,
a little more than two years ago, I had definitely
before me the project of writing a Nelson novel
for the one-hundredth anniversary of the Battle
of the Nile (August 1st, 1898), I have read
most of the important works dealing with
Lord Nelson&rsquo;s life, especially Captain Mahan&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
&ldquo;Life of Nelson,&rdquo; which is a monument of
impartiality, research, and the application of
professional knowledge to literature. I have
also, by the kindness of Lord Dundonald, Mr.
Morrison, and others, had the opportunity of
seeing a quantity of unpublished Nelsoniana,
which have been of the utmost value to me in
forming a final opinion of the character of my
hero.</p>

<p>The main object of this book is to present to
the reader, in the year of the centenary of the Nile,
the real Nelson, without extenuation or malice.
No doubt it would have been easier to ensure
popularity by passing over the weaknesses in his
character and representing him only as an ever-victorious
warrior. But this did not seem to me
the right course to pursue with a character like
Nelson. Those who have studied his letters in
the pages of Nicolas and Laughton, and those
who have studied his life in the pages of Captain
Mahan (who, it must be remembered, is a
professional writer, the chief naval expert of the
United States, writing upon the greatest English
sea-strategist), cannot fail to have been impressed
by the intensely human note which he struck
in almost every letter.</p>

<p>People love to read about Nelson, not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vii]</a></span>
because he was the greatest sea-commander who
ever lived, but because his own personal character
was so extraordinarily vehement and interesting.
He was a law unto himself. As a commander
he forced his way into recognition by detecting,
and acting in defiance of, the errors of his
superiors, even of men like St. Vincent. He
continued to do so when he was an Admiral
commanding fleets whose destruction would have
meant almost national ruin. And he was as
much a law unto himself in his private life.
&ldquo;A law unto himself&rdquo; might have been his
motto. It was the keynote of his force.</p>

<p>But even Nelson, absolutely fearless as he was
of danger and responsibility, could hardly have
extorted the liberty to assert this force of
character if it had not been tempered by one
of the most lovable dispositions recorded of a
public man. Nearly all who were ever thrown
into contact with him were his willing slaves,
or affectionate friends&mdash;even the grim old St.
Vincent and the austere Hood. He was the
most considerate, the most sympathetic, the most
generous of shipmates. His very simplicity was
fascinating, and he was wonderfully simple where
his affections were concerned, though he showed
such intuition in gauging the character of a knave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
or an enemy, and in forecasting the movements of
politicians, as well as of hostile commanders.</p>

<p>Nelson had the same faith in those he loved as
he had in his own genius. In the hour of danger
his spirit rose to the sublime, and the bodily
ailments to which he was so constantly a prey,
left him. In the hours of waiting, when anxieties
were accumulating and action was impossible,
his state of health sank very low. His passion
for Lady Hamilton shows how infatuated he
could become over a woman who appealed to
his imagination. Few women in history have
possessed her great qualities in a higher degree
than Lady Hamilton at the time when Nelson
first came under her influence, in 1798, after the
Battle of the Nile. Her letters to Mr. Greville
and Sir William Hamilton prove that she must
have had a delightful disposition, and the part
she took in the stirring events of 1798 and 1799
shows her imagination, her daring, and her
ability.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, at the risk of raising a
stormy discussion, to present the character of
Nelson exactly as it was in 1798 and the first
half of 1799; and to present a general view of the
historical events in which he formed the central
figure, though I am aware that certain passages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
in the book, such as <a href="#chap17">Chapter XVII.</a>, form rather
heavy reading for a novel. But, to bring out
the character of Nelson, it was necessary to detail
the tangled political problems with which he was
confronted. As Captain Mahan pointed out,
Nelson was one of the most astute politicians of
his day, as well as the greatest sea-commander.</p>

<p>A large part of the book is in Nelson&rsquo;s own
words. Appreciating the importance, in treating
a national hero, of keeping as close as possible
to history, <em>I have, wherever it was feasible, used,
whether in dialogue or description, the actual
words of Nelson and his contemporaries</em>. These
I have derived from his own published and
unpublished correspondence and journals, from
the narratives of his officers, and similar sources.
Similarly, I have derived my chapter on his visit
to Pompeii largely from an account of a visit
to Pompeii written in 1802. The style of the
narrator of the story, Captain Thomas Trinder,
is founded upon unpublished journals and letters
of the time, in the possession of my father. They
were mostly written by his godfather, Mr. Henry
Brooke, who lived at Walmer, and may be taken
as fair specimens of the writing of the travelled
and better-educated Kentish gentleman of his
day. Mr. Brooke was one of the last heads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
the now abolished Alien Office, and as such had
much to do with the French princes exiled in
England during the Napoleonic r&eacute;gime. He was
also present at the restoration of the French
monarchy. Some of the pieces of queer grammar,
such as &ldquo;I have wrote,&rdquo; were probably idiomatic
at the time, others are mere loose writing.</p>

<p>The scene of the book is mostly laid in Naples
and Sicily, and to acquire the requisite local knowledge
I have paid two long visits to these places
in 1896-8. The Mont&rsquo; alto Palace and the
Castle of the Favara, in fact nearly all the buildings
described, actually exist, though in most cases they
are much decayed or altered. The Hamiltons&rsquo;
Palace at Naples, though now divided into apartments,
remains much as it was, except that, in
Nelson&rsquo;s time, the sea came close up to it. The
features of the sea-front of Naples are very much
altered since then; but the Comte de la Ville,
who is at the head of the <i>Storia Patria</i>, the
excellent historical society of Naples, was kind
enough to show me almost contemporary plans
of the places described. And here I wish to
take the opportunity of pointing out that the
Neapolitans and Sicilians of to-day differ as much
from the corrupt hangers-on of the Bourbons as
the English public men of to-day differ from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
venal followers of Sir Robert Walpole. I need
hardly say that the denunciations of them, and
above all of the French, are not my own, but
always derived from Nelson&rsquo;s expressed sentiments,
and nearly always given in his exact words.</p>

<p>In criticising the characters of my heroines it
must be remembered that the morals of the
Neapolitan court in the time of Maria Carolina
are indescribable in an English novel; but this, as
a matter of fact, is the one point in which I have
shrunk from presenting things without extenuation.
It will be noticed that at the period of
which I write, the year of the Nile, I believe
Lady Hamilton to have been a lovely and
enchanting woman, and that I believe that the
connection between Nelson and her began as a
pure romance, each worshipping the other as the
most splendid human being in the world. The
beautiful letter of hero-worship which she wrote
to him after the battle of the Nile I first saw in
its entirety in Professor Laughton&rsquo;s sumptuous
volume, &ldquo;The Companions of Nelson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I conclude I have to express my thanks
to Mr. E. Neville-Rolfe, British Consul at Naples;
to the Marquis A. de Gregorio, and the Messrs.
Whitaker, of Palermo; and to Miss A. Mason,
a great-niece of Nelson, besides those whom I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
have mentioned above. I am also indebted to
the writings of Mr. Clark Russell; to the highly
valuable and hitherto unpublished Nelson documents
which have been appearing in <i>Literature</i>;
to the accurate and splendidly illustrated Nelsoniana
which have been appearing in the popular
illustrated Service paper, <i>The Army and Navy
Illustrated</i>, and in the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>;
and to Lord Charles Beresford&rsquo;s and Mr. H.&nbsp;W.
Wilson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nelson and his Times,&rdquo; which was
published as a supplement to the <i>Daily Mail</i>.
I have followed Lord Charles&rsquo;s view of Nelson
himself more closely than any other, because it
is so sympathetic, and is written by one who is
at once a brilliant naval expert and the sea-commander
to whom the nation looks for exploits
like Nelson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I am prepared for much censure and acrimonious
discussion, especially over the very
point upon which I take my stand, that a novel
dealing with the character of Nelson ought
above all things to be a human document.
He is, to me, the most intensely human figure
in History.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="prologue" id="prologue"></a><span class="smcap">Prologue.</span>&mdash;Introducing the
Reader to the Lady Katherine
Fleet.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y Lord Eastry belonged to the grand old race of
East Kent squires, who brought up their sons
to fear nothing and hate the French, aye, and
brought up their daughters to be the wives and mothers
of men who should sail the salt seas till too stiff with age
or wounds to climb to their quarter-decks. For how could
their sons help going to sea when they saw the boatmen of
Deal from their open beach defying the guns of the French
and the might of the fiercest storms that blew?</p>

<p>My Lord Eastry began his bold life as younger son
of a squire, who bore the old Kent name of Fleet. But
of John Fleet, the eldest, there is only an empty memorial
in Eastry Church, which records that &ldquo;his body lies in
the great South Seas in the hope of a joyful resurrection.&rdquo;
His ship, full of honour and glory and prize-money, was
spoken two days east of Trinidad in the great storm of
1759; and mariners maintain that fighting Jack Fleet&rsquo;s
black frigate sails there still, whenever the cyclone is
coming down, with canvas enough on her to overset a
hundred-gun ship. And Dick had his call on the glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
1st of June&mdash;had the van-ship and sailed into the French
with the grand air of his family, as if he never could have
his belly full of fighting&mdash;laid alongside half a dozen of
them at one time and another, and had a chain-shot through
his middle just as he sent the <i>Vengeur</i> to the bottom with
her colours in the act of striking. Once he was hard
pressed, though; and Harry, the Lord Eastry that, as he
lay dying, drank Wellington&rsquo;s health when the news was
brought of Waterloo, saw it and, leaving the line flat
in neglect of signals, bore up to him. Lord! what a
family they were to fight! When the tall <i>Ramillies</i> ran
in between the <i>Brunswick</i> and the <i>Achille</i> to receive her
fire, it was like an explosion of devils from hell. The men,
men of the Cinque Ports that all had a dead father or a
dead brother to charge to the French, would have followed
Jack, Dick, or Harry into Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s fiery furnace.</p>

<p>Well, Harry Fleet&mdash;the Lord Harry, as they called him
in the Channel&mdash;came safe out of the great battle; and
not so many months afterwards fell upon a great convoy
guarded by ships that should have blown his squadron
of frigates out of the water, drove their escort under the
guns of Martinique, and carried the convoy, with the
army on board them that should have taken our Indies,
safe into Antigua, from which he brought home more
prize-money than ever. He was just too late to close the
eyes of his father, the tough old squire of Eastry who
lived his fourscore-and-odd years like his fathers before
him, the few of them that did not die with their shoes
on and the flag overhead.</p>

<p>They made him the Lord Eastry and a Knight of the
Bath, but he had had so much lead through his leg by
that time, that he could never fight a ship again, so he
came to the old home at Eastry to find his fourteen-year
old daughter the most wonderful bit of woman&rsquo;s flesh
in all the halls of Kent. Captain Jack and Captain Dick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
were never married. What children they may have had
fell not into any list of the landed gentry, and so it came
that the long-descended lands of the Fleets, and Admiral
my Lord Eastry&rsquo;s prodigious coffers of prize-money must
all come to Katherine Fleet, now the Lady Katherine.</p>

<p>Now, no man that ever breathed was less of a coxcomb
than Admiral Harry, but as the name of his ancient family
was to pass out of the earth with his death, he looked to it
that the son-in-law who succeeded to his honours and his
great estate should be of such rank and fame that it might
be no regret even for the Fleets of Eastry to be lost in their
greater honours: some Duke it might be, or at least an
Earl, whose belted ancestors had fought for the White or
Red Rose; and Katherine Fleet, aged now eighteen, might
have had any such an one as came within the magic of
her moods.</p>

<p>There are some women who are not completely graceful,
and yet give the onlooker a great sense of satisfaction.
There is a sort of wild freedom, a declaration of strength
and health, an evidence of courage and high spirits, which
bespeak an animal perfection too intense for the gentle ease
of grace. Katherine was one of those mettlesome women
who make men&rsquo;s blood tingle, and whose own red blood
never runs cold in the direst peril. I suppose she was
tall. She would have looked it had she been more than
common short. She was such a noble creature, and she
had the same blue eyes that were worth a dozen pikes to
the Lord Eastry, when, in his old frigate days, he had jumped
aboard a Frenchman and a wave had checked half his
boarding party&mdash;gay blue eyes withal, that could laugh
like her dimples and white teeth&mdash;gay blue eyes that could
be as loving or reckless as the mobile mouth. And she had
the pure curves of cheek and eyebrow which are almost
necessary to beauty absolute like hers.</p>

<p>What follows, I, Thomas Trinder, Captain retired on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
half-pay in His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy, and now of Beach Cottage,
Walmer, who am writing this chronicle, had from Will the
night before I led his sister to Ripple Church.</p>

<p>One March night of 1798 was Katherine&rsquo;s coming-out
ball. And her father&rsquo;s hopes looked like fulfilment, for the
greatest of Kentish peers, the young Marquis of Dover, had
been spending week after week at his mansion of Pegwell,
where never within the memory of the countryside, which
noted all his doings, had he spent two days on end. And
Katherine in a ball-room was a witch. She danced as such
women do, light-footed and tireless, radiating health and
high spirits, and with the unconscious smile of conquest on
their lips, until the victor comes who makes them replace
it with the most exquisite gentleness.</p>

<p>People looked to see that in Lady Katherine, before the
night was dead, for Ralph, Marquis of Dover, Earl of River,
Viscount Ripple, and Baron Waldershare, all in the Peerage
of England, and Lord Lieutenant of the County of Kent.
For he was a fine man, who rode straight to hounds, and
had already climbed high in the Government, and Katherine
had shown herself well inclined to him.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>The great minuet was to be at midnight, and Katherine
was promised to Lord Dover for it. In his fine scarlet
uniform of Lord Lieutenant, he was already waiting for
her in the door of the great barn with transepts like a
church, which had been turned into a ball-room, decked
with the trophies of Lord Eastry&rsquo;s wars.</p>

<p>For in another two or three minutes the first stroke
would clang from the tower of Eastry&rsquo;s little Norman
church. Katherine had been up to her room,&mdash;she had
girlish vanity enough to wish to look her best in the great
minuet,&mdash;and now she was stepping down the stairway with
an eloquent hesitancy, her left hand clearing from her lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
feet the heavy shimmery satin, which, young as she was,
it seemed natural for such an imperial woman to wear.
Dividing the line between her beautiful throat and her
shoulders, were the famous pearls that were the trophy
of Lord Eastry&rsquo;s wildest exploit.</p>

<p>Who could doubt but that when she went out from
that minuet, it would be to have the greatest name in all
the kingdom of Kent offered for her keeping?</p>

<p>But suddenly, through the open, ivy-shrouded Elizabethan
pane at the turn of the stair, came a low voice,&mdash;a young
voice, with the low distinctness which I shall never forget,&mdash;&ldquo;Kitty
Fleet, Kitty Fleet, is it you, Kitty Fleet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light came over the girl&rsquo;s face, which, I am prepared
to swear, the great Marquess of Dover had never seen, as
she replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Will! keep in the shadow, and I&rsquo;ll come&mdash;but
only for a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, instead of doing as she bade him, he came right
into the door,&mdash;into the full blaze of light. He was then
a fair boy of eighteen, and I can tell you that his charming
figure was shown off to great advantage by the quaint
dress of our day,&mdash;the tight-fitting Nankeen hose and short
dark blue jacket. And when he bared his head he showed
fair hair, as glossy and golden as Katherine&rsquo;s own, in
a very long queue. I can picture him fidgeting with
his sugar-loaf beaver, for he had something great on his
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;we shall be discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; began Kitty; and suddenly prepared to fly,
as the first stroke of twelve rang out painfully clear to
her anxious ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with the Admiral, Kitty, and you know what
that means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;that is, what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
&ldquo;It means,&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s Admiral Nelson: and it means
that I shall never come back at all, or come back a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you start, Will?&rdquo; asked Katherine, forgetting
all about the minuet and her marquess, and coming forward
to take his hands and look into his face. At eighteen
it was a beautiful face, but even then so proud that its
natural frankness was almost obscured. And yet you
forgave its haughtiness, for you felt that such pride would
not stoop to anything cowardly or mean, anything that
would prevent its keeping itself aloof and aloft. As she
took his hands in hers I know how the stern, clean-cut
mouth melted into one of the irresistible smiles that such
mouths mostly have once in a way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was wondering why did you
not come to my coming-out ball&mdash;you, Will, my best friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see my Lord Dover&rsquo;s triumph when he had won
you, Kitty?&rdquo; he asked almost bitterly: &ldquo;I could not bear it.
No, I should not have come at all if I had not been going
by the morning coach with my mother to Portsmouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Will, what is Lord Dover to me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will your father say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father will say nothing. I have no need to marry
the first lover with a title who presents himself. I am
a lord&rsquo;s daughter, passing rich&mdash;and passably good-looking,
Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be serious, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I must, and say good-bye, Will,&rdquo; she cried, as
the strokes had ceased ringing out from Eastry Tower some
two or three minutes, &ldquo;for the minuet was for twelve
o&rsquo;clock, and I am engaged to Lord Dover&mdash;for that only.
Good-bye, dear Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse she sprang forward, and laying
her hands on his shoulders kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
Hardly had she finished, when&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried a bluff voice, with an
accompanying thud of a lame man&rsquo;s stick on the polished
oak floor&mdash;&ldquo;Will Hardres off to fight the French! Nay, lad,
not so sudden! the coach does not start till six, and Cissy&rsquo;s
at school, and your mother going with you. This way,
this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led Will into the ball-room and up to the Marquess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a favour to ask you, my Lord Dover. I wish
Will Hardres here,&rdquo; the nobleman bowed, &ldquo;to lead the
minuet with my daughter. We Fleets think it the greatest
honour in the world to fight the French in a King&rsquo;s ship;
and Will is to have the special honour of sailing with
Admiral Nelson&mdash;a greater man, to my mind, than St.
Vincent, or Hood, or Howe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said the Marquess, in such a chilling
way that Will, as he said, could have killed him, and I
know the kind of light which came into Katherine&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot take my Lord Marquess&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, by G&mdash;d, you shall take my daughter herself, if
she&rsquo;ll have you,&rdquo; said Lord Eastry, more thoroughly roused
and vexed with himself for the slight he had put upon the
Marquess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By G&mdash;d, he shall, if he&rsquo;ll have me,&rdquo; said Katherine, also
roused, and using her father&rsquo;s not very elegant language.</p>

<p>Poor Will, the very pattern of good manners, which were
well nigh all that his widowed mother had to bestow upon
him, was dumfounded. In a moment of pique Katherine
and her father had bestowed her hand upon him&mdash;that
which he coveted more than anything else in the world,
and dared not covet; and the bestowal had been made in
a manner and language so extraordinary that he was at a
loss how to effect the acceptance.</p>

<p>For the moment the Marquess came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I am to have the honour&mdash;for the minuet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>It was not natural to Katherine not to be gracious; and
she had months of remembered kindnesses to this man&rsquo;s
credit. Indeed she had come within an ace of thinking of
him as her husband. So she accepted the situation with
womanly tact, she afterwards maintaining that she spoke
as little as she might.</p>

<p>She danced the minuet with grave sweetness and gentleness,
which, in a mischievous girl like Katherine, who was
little more than a child, was, in itself, an ominous sign for
the Marquess.</p>

<p>She also cast from time to time a tender glance, a
speaking smile, to Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said his lordship, bitterly&mdash;he could
not be chilling to Katherine, who had his heart&mdash;&ldquo;that you
are stepping with me, and dancing with that boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am but lately affianced to him, my lord,&rdquo; retorted
Katherine, this time with mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;re taking this tomfoolery
seriously, Lady Katherine&mdash;Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no tomfoolery to me, my lord,&rdquo; she said, with
a flash of rising anger that warned him. &ldquo;I had kissed
him my love, before you nettled my father into giving me
the leave he might never have given otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the minuet was over, and Katherine had
suffered herself to be led into one of the aisles of the barn
which had been rigged into a ball-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kitty,&rdquo; cried the Marquess, with a change of tone,
which made her woman&rsquo;s heart gentle to him, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
call it that name again, because it makes you angry; but
tell me that you did not mean it seriously, for you know I
have loved you three months past, and been waiting for the
opportunity you have always fenced off with some jest or
piece of mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And could you not guess why, my lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he echoed, sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
&ldquo;Because I knew I did not love you honestly, and,
warmly as I liked you, I was waiting to see if I could
love you. You may rely on it, that when I felt myself
conquered, I should have thrown down my weapons and
surrendered at discretion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And can you not love me yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never now, my lord, more than a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Because events have been like runaway
horses to-night. They have taken the bits between their
teeth and dashed us over a precipice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against your will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, not against my will; but it was a leap I might
never have dared to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you mean to marry him, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord; when he is a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not; but manhood comes quickly in these
piping times, and lives are short,&rdquo; she added, with a little
break in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he goes to sea to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to-day,&rdquo; she answered, with a bigger break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am an ill friend to be keeping you from him,&rdquo;
he said, his better nature asserting itself at the sight of the
sorrow of the woman he loved so well. &ldquo;Good-bye, Kitty,&rdquo;
he said gravely, bowing to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my lord. You are not angry with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; not with you. Not angry, but hurt, and heart-sick.
You will be my friend still, little Lady Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am five feet six, Lord Dover. Is that tall enough
to be the friend of a Marquess and the Lord Lieutenant
of Kent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is tall enough for my heart, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not talk of your heart any more, or I shall
not let you come and see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I may come and see you still, and walk and ride
with you still. How often may I come and see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As often as you can bring me news of the fleet&mdash;Admiral
Nelson&rsquo;s fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This account of the leave-taking from Lord Dover I had
from Katherine, the day I had the honour of becoming her
brother-in-law, through Will&rsquo;s sister Cecilia. But what
took place at her leave-taking from her boy-lover I never
had, for that is sacred to the girl and boy, who have the
honour of being lovers still.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span>&mdash;Of the finding of
Lord Nelson&rsquo;s Journal.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS sitting with Will in the morning-room of his
mansion of Eastry, which he had with Katherine,
when one of his footmen came in to announce that
a lady wished to speak to him very particularly. She
refused to give her name, but she came on a matter of
great importance connected with Lord Nelson, whose
confidence Captain Hardres had enjoyed. It was, she told
the footman, a very intimate personal matter in connection
with his late Lordship.</p>

<p>Now, Will was not ordinarily what is called an approachable
person; but she had hit upon the password to
which he never could turn a deaf ear, and he directed that
she should be shown in.</p>

<p>No sooner had she entered the door, carrying a bundle,
which, to the footman&rsquo;s evident distress, she had refused to
trust out of her own hands, than, seeing me, she stopped.
But Will said, in cold tones that would have frightened
any one not sure of her mission, &ldquo;This gentleman also
had the honour of serving under the Admiral.&rdquo; To all
who had served under that immortal man he was always
&ldquo;the Admiral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at us both, and I am vain enough to think
that she felt my presence would make what she had come
to say easier, rather than more difficult, though Will&rsquo;s face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
had softened when he saw that she was a gentlewoman of
reduced circumstances.</p>

<p>The bundle she had brought with her, tied up in a piece
of faded green silk, contained something hard and square.
When she unknotted it and produced three leather-bound
volumes of the kind used for journals, and opened one at
random, Will might have seen a ghost.</p>

<p>This was in the year 1819, you must remember,&mdash;long
years after the Admiral had seen his work finished, and had
passed away like Moses in sight of the fulfilled promise.
And Will, who had been in constant personal attendance
nearer and more confidential than a secretary, saw before
him, as plainly as his eyes could show him, three volumes
of the identical kind always employed by the Admiral for
his private affairs, and written, as it seemed to Will, by
the Admiral&rsquo;s very own hand. And Will, though he was
not wise in book-learning, nor had given much attention
to such matters, had had the very best opportunities for
observing the Admiral&rsquo;s writing. He knew every turn in
the clear but shaky characters, written with the left hand
by one accustomed till he was more than thirty-five years
old to penning with his right. The binding, the paper,
and the ink, as well as the handwriting, were the counterparts
of what Will had seen so often before the Admiral on
his desk.</p>

<p>The old lady did not offer a word of explanation until we
had examined them for some minutes, and, looking up, had
laid them down, and then she told us a likely story enough.</p>

<p>It came out that she was Mrs. Hunter, and the good soul
who had taken my Lady Hamilton, then like to die, and
in great destitution, into her house at Boulogne, and had
sheltered her and maintained and nursed her free of charge
until her death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These three volumes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;were her Ladyship&rsquo;s
last and greatest treasure, which she never would have far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
away from her, and which, when she was alone, she read
to her great comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Lady Hamilton, some hours before her death, felt
that the end was surely coming, not having (after all the
fortune which had poured through her hands) the wherewithal
to pay a lawyer&rsquo;s fee for drawing up a will, she had
given her these books, bidding her to sell them, and take
what they brought to recompense her for her kindness and
the expense to which she had been put. They were, her
Ladyship said, journals of the years 1798, 1799 and 1800;
the happiest years of her life, which she had spent in his
Lordship&rsquo;s friendship on the shores of their beloved Mediterranean,
and presented by him to her as a memorial of
them. Had the ungrateful nation not neglected his last
charge that it should maintain her, she would have bequeathed
these volumes to it; but seeing that Mrs. Hunter
had proved herself her best friend since Lord Nelson&rsquo;s
glorious death, it was right that she should have them to
sell and recompense herself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, having been given by My Lady Captain
Hardres&rsquo;s name, among others of his Lordship&rsquo;s dearest
friends,&mdash;Will bowed gravely,&mdash;and the sailing packet which
had brought her from Boulogne having landed her at Dover,
she had come to him first, as being the nearest of the
gentlemen mentioned (Eastry is but a few miles from
Dover); and then she came direct to the point&mdash;would Will
purchase these journals of the Admiral?</p>

<p>She named a very great price; but then Will, living
in such a mansion-house as Eastry, in the style that he
affected, was clearly a man of great means.</p>

<p>As I expected, he would not promise her at once, and
inquired where she would sleep for the night; and, I think,
he was about to require her to leave them with him until
the morning, which I am sure to the simple soul would
have seemed like leaving her purse in a strange house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
when Katherine came in, looking like her own daughter,
with the added gentleness of years of happy wifehood,
though she was a mettlesome creature, and not to be
frightened by Will or the devil.</p>

<p>Will put his arm round her youthful waist, and led her
into the oriel to repeat everything, she glancing from time
to time at Mrs. Hunter. When he had finished they
came back again, and Will began, with some hesitation,
&ldquo;Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; when Katherine, reading what was in his
eyes, said, &ldquo;You are never going to let her who performed
the last offices for the woman the Admiral loved with all
the wealth of his great heart&mdash;you are never going to let the
lady sleep in a poor village inn, when there are two of the
Admiral&rsquo;s officers in this very house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which Will replied gallantly, &ldquo;You are the mistress
of this house, Kitty, and such an invitation should come
from a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think he was glad of the proposal, for it gave him the
opportunity of judging the woman that would sell the
books, as well as the books she would sell. Though no
talker, Will was, as silent men are apt to be, an observer
of character, and I could tell that he was not wholly
satisfied.</p>

<p>And so it was settled that a groom or a gardener should
bring her box from the inn, and she dined and slept and
breakfasted the following morning at Eastry Place. Will
had her on his right hand at meals, and talked with her
while we were in the ladies&rsquo; company after dinner; though
I own we joined them late, for we had the journals at the
table while we sat over Madeira wine that had laid in
the Goodwin Sands for many a year in a wreck that was
bared by their shifting&mdash;as fine a wine as ever came into
East Kent, duty or no duty.</p>

<p>Katherine, of course, saw much more of her than we,
and had the more opportunity of judging her. Katherine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
was no mean judge, though ever inclined to condone those
whom her judgment condemned. To Katherine&rsquo;s eye, as
well as our own, the creature had certain faults. As she
felt the more at home her garrulity and vanity ran away
with her, till she almost claimed her share of credit for the
Admiral&rsquo;s victories by some retrospective process of merit.
In fact, like other garrulous persons, she was inclined to
fire without loading. But there did not seem any reason
to doubt that she was the Mrs. Hunter who had befriended
Lady Hamilton, which was, after all, the chief query.</p>

<p>Well, Will and I turned those journals over and over,
at first while we were sitting over our Madeira, and afterwards
far into the night over our pipes and grog; and, try
where we would, we could find nothing that seemed in the
penmanship of another hand, or that the Admiral, knowing
him as we did, might not have put down in a journal; for
he was ever fond of his pen, and in the wont of writing
down what he felt strongly, and more especially is it true
that when he was out of health, which was so often the
case, he would examine himself and discuss from every
point what he had done or should do.</p>

<p>In a matter like that of his affection for my Lady
Hamilton, it was of course impossible for him, by reason
of his position in the Service, as well as of his greatness,
to talk with any on the ship; and what he could not say
in words it was quite in keeping with his habits for him
to commit carefully to paper, it may be, all along with
the idea of presenting them for My Lady&rsquo;s reading as
another proof of his sincere esteem, but more likely at
first, at any rate, to ease his soul. And therefore, when
the morning came and we had risen from breakfast, after
a short absence with Katherine, Will came to Mrs. Hunter,
whom he had left with me in the gentle sunshine on the
terrace, and said that he should give her the price she asked.
Which he did, by order on Mr. Laurie&rsquo;s bank at Dover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
I think we were all glad to be rid of Mrs. Hunter, even
Katherine, who made excuses for her as being old, and
a woman, though I know of few men worthy to be
compared with such a woman as Katherine. It was
Katherine who decided him, for she had read her Roman
history and knew the story about the Sybil bringing nine
precious books to the Roman King, and, when he would
not have them at her price, destroying three of them,
and offering him the six for the same price, and when he
would not have the six, destroying three more, until he
gave her for the last three the money for which he might
have had the whole nine.</p>

<p>She did not, she confessed, expect Mrs. Hunter to burn
her books; but, remembering the regret of the King
when he found the value of the three remaining books
which he had bought, thought that Will might feel
just such a regret if he lost for ever the opportunity of
buying what seemed to be the journals of the Admiral,
to whom England and he owed everything. The story
of the Sybilline books was new to Will, and impressed
him mightily. I daresay it did not lose anything in the
telling. Katherine was, after all, a woman, and she had
read it in her childhood.</p>

<p>This was, as I have said, in the year 1819, four years
after the death of her Ladyship. If Mrs. Hunter had
brought them to us at once, upon the death of her
Ladyship, while the country was ringing with the announcement
of it, ten days after she died, in the <i>Morning Post</i>,
and with the talk of the Admiral&rsquo;s brother, the Earl, going
over to Calais to see what papers she might have left
behind her, I think Will might have done something about
them there and then. The Earl&rsquo;s visit in search of papers
would be taken by some as sufficient evidence that he
knew of the existence of these journals, though I would
not dare to say so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
But, as it was, he bought them rather for our private
reading, to recall our adored Admiral; and it was not until
he had had them in his possession for years, that the thought
came to him of giving them to the public to counteract the
false and erroneous statements and judgments, which
seemed to be for ever on the increase.</p>

<p>Now Will, living inland at Eastry, with the affairs of a
great estate to administer, had little leisure or inclination
for writing, even if he had had the power, but he was a
man of action only, one of the kind that make history and
leave it for smaller men, like myself, to chronicle it;
while I, living at Walmer, on the sea-shore, in the midst of
many retired naval men, and much discussion of naval
affairs, had fallen into a pernicious habit of writing letters to
the <i>Post</i>, giving an old salt&rsquo;s plain condemnations of this and
the other shortcomings, and writing over the signature of
&lsquo;Cinque Ports&rsquo; indignant refutations of anything that was
said against the memory of the Admiral. So Will had
come to look upon me for as great a writer as the mysterious
Scotchman, who wrote, the year before we had the journals,
&ldquo;The Heart of Midlothian&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bride of Lammermoor,&rdquo;
and who, if you could believe the reviewers, was the
only writer in the three kingdoms worthy of any consideration
for any writing but poetry. Having married Will&rsquo;s
sister, and having nothing to do but to make the best living
I could on my stored-up prize money and my half-pay, I often
took her to Eastry. It was on one of these visits, while we
were keeping the fire warm before we went to bed, that
Will took the pipe from between his lips, and said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas, I have been thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unless his mind lay fallow, he must have thought a good
deal in his long, frequent silences. However, Will was not
a man to jest with, so I made no comment of this kind, but
waited to hear, understanding that he had a decision to
communicate to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thomas, I have been thinking that we are getting on in
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed indisputable, but I did not know that I
wished to be reminded of it. I again waited, until he came
to the point that we, from our close personal attendance on
him, knew much about the Admiral which perhaps ought
not to be lost to the world, and that he thought that I should
write it down, and give with it such portions of the
Admiral&rsquo;s journals as seemed necessary for letting the
public know how sincerely that immortal man always
endeavoured to do the right.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span>&mdash;Introducing the
Admiral.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND now it is time for me to tell you how first I
met Will.</p>

<p>I was the jest of the ship. The mids in the
gun-room hit off the keynote of my personal appearance
when they christened me Tubby the very first day I went
on shipboard; and Tubby I remained till I was given a
command on the captured sloop <i>St. Malo</i>, in the year 18&mdash;.
It was recognised at once that I could stand a good deal
more than my share of gun-room wit without quarrelling,
though I showed no deficiency in pluck when it came to
going aloft in heavy weather, or steering a boat under heavy
fire; and I was popular, I believe, though no one thought
me worth considering. I was not born to be considered: I
was born to attach myself to a strong nature, to subordinate
myself to its will and enjoy its glory as if it were my own.
My friendship with Will has filled my life. For all the years
during which we were shipmates, my thoughts were hardly
ever off Will Hardres; and now that we are both of us laid
on the shelf on this windy coast of Kent, because Europe is
so exhausted that there will never be any wars again, my
little crib is within an old pony&rsquo;s amble of his mansion-house
of Eastry, and my wife, his sister, leads me the same
dance as Will led me&mdash;God bless her!</p>

<p>I am not like to forget the first day we met. The wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
was roaring; the sky was a feather-bed of clouds; the
ships were forging up and down at their anchors; their
cables and timbers were cracking rather than creaking,
even under the lee of the land; and the waves looked like
sweeping away the narrow spit of shore which shuts out
the sea and makes Brading Harbour.</p>

<p>We had a noble fleet. A few men-of-war on their way
out to join my Lord St. Vincent, Commander-in-Chief in
the Mediterranean, and with them the Portugal, Gibraltar,
and Mediterranean convoy, lay in the roads between
St. Helen&rsquo;s, in the Isle of Wight, and Spithead, on the
morning of that 8th of April, 1798, waiting for the gale to
drop or shift from the south-west, till when they were
wind-bound,&mdash;for the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Our ship, the <i>Vanguard</i>, a fine seventy-four, was one of
the nearest in-shore, for we had the Admiral aboard.</p>

<p>Walking up and down the slippery deck with Berry, our
Captain, was a most remarkable-looking little man. His
shoulders were made to appear narrower than they really
were by the loss of his right arm and the way he pulled
his coat round it. A certain peculiarity in his gait was
probably due to the same cause. The flowing hair which
almost concealed his ears, the ruddy skin and bright blue
eyes would alone have attracted attention. It was a small
face, with certain very marked features. The forehead was
lofty, though narrow; the nose was long, and almost
straight; the chin, though very strong, was not broad;
and his mouth, which was noticeably large, was the most
extraordinarily sensitive mouth I have ever seen. In
remarking its size, it was not the length that you noted,
but the range and flexibility of the lips. This contributed
largely to the wonderful expressiveness of the face.</p>

<p>His eyebrows, too, were very marked; they were bent
rather than curved, and had a curious little upward curl
at the end. But his eyes, with his mouth, were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
features of his face. For being of the bright blue which is
hardly ever dissociated from courage and resoluteness, they
gave the face its strength; and they were the most remarkable
I have ever seen in this way,&mdash;that while cruelty, or
at the least callousness, and insensibility to any emotions
but animal passions and anger, are frequently the other
characteristics of eyes of this particular bright blue, his
eyes had instead the tenderness, the sensibility, the
imaginativeness of large eyes which sometimes look
greyish-brown and sometimes brownish-grey.</p>

<p>And herein lay the index to his whole character. For
once in the world, dark-eyed genius was found in the
same body as blue-eyed recklessness. He had at once
head and heart and backbone. And sometimes his poor
little weakling body was wrung almost dry of blood by
the mighty soul which struggled within it. But as Will&rsquo;s
eyes first fell on him that day he was a little thin man,
crooked with the loss of his arm, and with wild hair
tumbling over a small weather-ruddied face with petulant
eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>That was his expression when worried with forced
inaction, or being chained to mere routine with no prospect
of an occasion which demanded ability to meet it. But
when such an occasion arose this expression was replaced
by the smiling serenity and confidence of the portrait
painted in the year of the Nile.</p>

<p>The narrowness of chin and forehead, and the general
smallness of the face, I have always considered as the
physiognomical expression of the concentration and intenseness
of his character.</p>

<p>This little man was the great Admiral who was one
day to be Lord Nelson, and leave such a name behind
him as no sailor who ever sailed the sea left before him,
or is ever like to leave. I was standing to take orders,
when suddenly the Admiral cried out, &ldquo;The devil take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
this wind, Berry! If the <i>Boadicea&rsquo;s</i> news be true, the
French in Brest will be ready for sea before it blows out,
and I shall have to fight them with my hands tied by the
convoy. I hate this convoying,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind what the
odds are in a fair fight. But they shall sink every King&rsquo;s
ship among us before they get away with any of my
convoy. Sink, I say!&mdash;there shall be no question of
capturing any fighting ship in my fleet. I hope that trial
of Williamson&rsquo;s will have its effect on officers going into
action. I was sorry for him: I do not grudge him getting
off with his life; I daresay that there were some favourable
circumstances, and it is ever a virtue to lean to the
side of mercy. But as to myself, upon the general question
that if a man does not do his utmost in time of action,
I think but one punishment ought to be inflicted. Not
that I take a man&rsquo;s merit from his list of killed and
wounded, for but little may be in his power; and if he
does his utmost in the station he is placed, he has equal
merit to the man who may have his ship beat to pieces,
but not his good fortune. I would have every man
believe I shall only take my chance of being shot by the
enemy, but if I do not take that chance I am certain of
being shot by my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, sir, that there is no captain in this fleet
but thinks the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that, Berry. I&rsquo;m glad of that. But I say,
the devil take this wind!&mdash;I shall never be quit of the sea-sickness
till we are out of this. Why, this very morning
... but no matter. We want some luck, Berry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear we cannot command that, sir; though Nelson&rsquo;s
luck is a proverb in the service. I know of no charm for
luck except to whistle for the wind. I do not know how to
unwhistle it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a proverb, Berry, my luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may take my word for that, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
The great little Admiral stroked his firm chin, and a glad
light broke into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they talk of men being born
under a lucky star. That is not the way I look at it, but
I have always believed that I was born to do the work of
Providence, which is perhaps what they mean. And I
think that Providence gives its little signs to those whom it
chooses for its instruments. But I have had no signs here&mdash;everything
is as thick as St. Helen&rsquo;s Church. It is not
a church now, you know, Berry, only a tower&mdash;only the
shell of a tower, I think, kept standing and washed with
white as a beacon to mariners. And, even lying in-shore
like this, we cannot see the beacon, it is so thick. However
long is it since we were able to communicate with shore,
Berry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than a week, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we have to take that draft on board to fill the
places of those sick and missing men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, thirty of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-one: at fewest there were twenty-five in hospital
and either five or six missing, when I wrote to their
Lordships; but since then I find that William O&rsquo;Brien is
missing, and that he boasted to his watch that he always
meant to desert when he got the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not a Norfolk man, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Berry; I would not lose him so lightly if he were
a Norfolk man. There is the greatest difference between
a forced man and a man who voluntarily offers his life to
preserve his country. These Norfolk lads are all volunteers,
come for the honour of the country, because their Admiral
is a Burnham man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred and more of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were silent for a bit, but presently the Admiral
began again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that young Hardres could not get to us&mdash;him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
that Lord Eastry wrote to me to have Thomas Irwine&rsquo;s
place, &lsquo;the finest and bravest boy Lord Eastry knew.&rsquo;
He was the sort we want. I met Harry Fleet when he
was captain of the <i>Ramillies</i>, and a finer captain never
sailed, of the old bull-dog sort, who did not know as much
as I like my captains to know, but who always laid their
ships alongside of the enemy. They were wonderful men
to fight, those three Fleets! And this young Hardres was
the finest and bravest boy Harry Fleet ever knew. What&rsquo;s
that coming along from the west&rsquo;ard, youngster? You take
my glass: I can&rsquo;t use it yet without feeling dizzy. I can&rsquo;t
quite shake off that miserable sea-sickness, while we are
lying-to doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a Portsmouth smack, sir,&rdquo; I said, after
peeping for a bit; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s only carrying such a rag
of sail that I cannot quite make her out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes a bold man,&rdquo; said the Admiral, &ldquo;to carry that
on a day like this. He must have despatches on board
from the Admiralty, or he&rsquo;d never have put out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two passengers, I make out now, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very important despatches, Berry. The French must
have got out of Brest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be alongside in a minute, sir, with this wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she came alongside and caught the rope I flung to
her, the man at the tiller sang out to lower the gangway.
&ldquo;Lady on board, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain looked at the Admiral. The weather was
too rough for lowering a gangway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower away,&rdquo; said the Admiral, with that little smile
he wore after he had prayed, when going into battle:
&ldquo;please God nothing shall ever frighten me&mdash;not even a
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gangway was lowered, and strong arms, using all
their dexterity, flung the larger bundle of oilskins into the
arms of the sailor standing on the bottom step; they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
going to follow with the thinner, taller bundle, but it shook
them off with indignation. The larger bundle was passed up;
the other scrambled up and stood on the deck bareheaded
in front of the Admiral and the Captain. The Admiral
conducted them along the slippery and unsteady deck
to his state-room under the quarter-deck, and with his
own hands peeled the oilskins from the lady, while the
Captain gave orders for cordials, and the other bundle
slipped back to the door of the state-room and began to lay
off its oilskins there.</p>

<p>It was a little, slim, fair woman who stood before the
hero, quite thinly clad when she removed the cloak under
the oilskins, and evidently a widow, but of some years&rsquo;
standing. She was the gentlest-looking creature imaginable,
except for a certain firmness about the pathetic little
mouth. The Admiral had signed to me to follow; he gave
me the oilskins to hold. It was just like him: not until
he had made the most solicitous inquiries and had offered
her everything in the ship, did he ask whom he had the
honour of addressing.</p>

<p>She took a sip of the cordial, and put her hand up to
her silky fair hair, and finding how wet it was, gave it
a little shake, as if she expected to dry herself like a dog.
And after the shake she looked at the Admiral, who was
re-beginning his inquiry with a considerable amount of
trepidation, when she cut him short with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Hardres: is it too late? We have been
waiting in Portsmouth since the beginning of the storm, and
this is the first day we have been able to get a boat to bring
us off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My missing midshipman,&rdquo; he cried gaily. &ldquo;Madam, it
is never too late to get a good officer; but where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will!&rdquo; called his mother. But there was no Will to be
found. The Admiral, with the smile for which any man in
his fleet was ready to die, flew to the door of the state-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
in front of Mrs. Hardres. She knew where to look for her
son. He was standing just outside the door in his new
midshipman&rsquo;s rig. His oilskins were lying folded in a neat
pile on the deck beside him, though it had come on to rain
in torrents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Will,&rdquo; said the Admiral, in his best-pleased
manner; and his satisfaction as he scanned him, face and
figure, was evident, though he expressed it indirectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a big fellow for a midshipman, Mrs. Hardres. I
was a post captain at twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only son of a widow, Sir Horatio. But the time
has come when the widow must give her mite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears came into the Admiral&rsquo;s eyes. I never knew a
man of such delicate sensibilities: though he did not know
what fear meant, he could weep like a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen, sir,&rdquo; said Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make haste and be a lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our Admiral would not hear of Mrs. Hardres going off
until the storm abated. In those days regulations were
not so hard-and-fast about the presence of ladies on board
a man-of-war, and the men who had brought her were
willing enough to stay. They had run down to the ship
before the wind, and they knew what it meant beating
back against that wind and that sea. Towards evening
the sea fell a good bit, and the thick weather cleared off,
though it continued to blow; and shortly before dark we
made out an Admiralty tender, which proved to have our
thirty men aboard. The Admiral was delighted, and making
his excuses to Mrs. Hardres, went off to write despatches.</p>

<p>When he had written them and paraded the new draft,
he stepped up to Mrs. Hardres and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go back, madam, in the state that befits a
gallant officer&rsquo;s mother. Lieutenant Morris, of the tender,
shall take charge of you,&rdquo; and at the same time he gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
the men who had brought her their golden guinea apiece,
for bringing him luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have a change in the wind now, Berry,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;within a day or two. I know that this lady&rsquo;s
coming is the sign I was waiting for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And dinner was then served, put forward for Mrs.
Hardres. And then, after many protestations of the
Admiral&rsquo;s kindness, and a grim, silent leave-taking, with
hardly-kept-back tears, from her boy, the gangway was
let down again. As she was leaving the ship, she said,
&ldquo;You will take care of him, Sir Horatio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral looked at her in his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean in the face of the enemy,&rdquo; she said
warmly, the pitiful mouth, for the moment, taking the
proud curves of her son&rsquo;s; &ldquo;but I have only a slender
purse,&mdash;his father was killed when he was a lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As regards that last, my dear madam, you may be
perfectly easy, for your son will be a very lucky fellow if
he gets on shore twice in a year. And for the rest, I shall
look after him as if he were my own son, and you know
where I should wish my son to be in the moment of
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span>&mdash;Of the Letters
of a Boy and a Girl.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILL duly wrote to Katherine from every port we
touched at: one on April 23rd, when we arrived
at Lisbon&mdash;one on April 30th, when we joined
the Earl of St. Vincent&rsquo;s fleet off Cadiz&mdash;one on May 7th,
from Gibraltar, the day before we sailed with a small squadron
of observation up the Mediterranean&mdash;one on May 25th,
when we put into S. Pierre&rsquo;s in Sardinia to repair damages
after we had been disabled and partly dismasted in the
great storm off Toulon&mdash;and one on June 17th, when we
were in the Bay of Naples after Captain Troubridge&rsquo;s
squadron had joined us. The only one I saw of them was
the last, he not knowing whether it was <em>Trow</em>bridge or
<em>Trou</em>bridge&mdash;a point I daresay Katherine would have waived
for a message that came a little straighter from his heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr"><span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;From His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Vanguard</i>.</span><br />
&ldquo;Off Naples, June 17th, 1798.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Kitty</span>,&mdash;I am no letter writer, besides all the news
there is of our being in pursuit of the French fleet and the
Admiral being joined by Ten of the Line under Captain Thomas
Trowbridge, making Thirteen in all, besides the <i>Leander</i>, 50
guns, I doubt not you will see in the <i>Gazette</i>. For the rest,
I have not been on shore once, and the Admiral treats me with
so much goodness as his own&mdash;that is Lady Nelson&rsquo;s, son&mdash;Lieut.
Nisbet. You may know how often I think of you, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
sailors have watches every day of four hours at a time when
they may do nothing. I read your letter which I had by the
Squadron before I go on watch.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="padright">&ldquo;Yours affectly,</span><br />
&ldquo;WILL HARDRES.</p>

<p class="addressl">&ldquo;To the Lady Katherine Fleet,<br />
&ldquo;At the House of my Lord Eastry,<br />
<span class="padleft">&ldquo;Near Dover.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it was not till we were joined by Captain Troubridge&rsquo;s
Squadron off Toulon, on June 7th, that Katherine&rsquo;s first
letter reached him, having missed us at Gibraltar. We
were by this time fast friends, though I was rather what
a schoolboy would call his fag, and he had such pride in
his letter that he showed it to me. It was not dated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr"><span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;Eastry Place,</span><br />
&ldquo;Near Dover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To my dearest Will</span>,&mdash;As I am to marry you, I may have
the writing, and am wishing to say not to lose your heart to the
black-browed dames I have read of in the <i>Beauty&rsquo;s Garland</i>.
The Marquess has shown me much goodness; although he often
comes to walk or ride with me he brings his <i>aide-de-camp</i> (he
is Lord Lieutenant, you know) or, when he has one at Pegwell
with him, his sister. They are very proud. The Ladies St.
Radigunde all made great matches, but I never was frightened,
as I let his sister the Dutchess know, and then wished I had
not, for she paid me compliments that vexed me&mdash;&lsquo;splendid
creature,&rsquo; and such, and vowed that I was the very woman to be
his Marchioness, and that I should be his Marchioness, to which
I replied setting her in her place, which alas! only increased her
devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will, dear, I miss you always, but the many times I thought
of marrying you before we were promised on that night, I never
doubted but that you would be much away on the seas. The
wives of our family love their husbands dearly, and are content
with a little. Indeed, Will, though I think I should not write it,
they are most of their lives but mothers, and many is the Fleet
who never saw his father. But I have no fear that I shall not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
see you for the marrying of me, and with you to be on the sea,
as Admiral Nelson told your mother, save perhaps for two days
in the year, it is only I who have to promise not to wander.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="padright">&ldquo;Your loving</span><br />
&ldquo;KATHERINE.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;My father says not to go on a frigate; there is treasure
in plenty here, and though frigates are good for prize-money, an
Admiral&rsquo;s ship is the path to promotion.</p>

<p class="addressl">&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Mr. Will Hardres</span>,<br />
&ldquo;On His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Vanguard</i>, etc., etc.,<br />
<span class="padleft">&ldquo;Mediterranean.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Naples, when we lay off on June 17th, and again at
Syracuse, we missed our letters; and it was not till after
the Nile that we had them, when Will had at one time
three from Katherine, writ by different ships.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span>&mdash;Of our Entry
into Syracuse.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Admiral bettered his promise to Mrs. Hardres.
He was not only a father to Will, but attached him
to his person as a sort of supernumerary member
of his staff. And Will wanted a good friend, for there is
no denying that he was none too popular with those who
should have been his mates. With the Admiral and the
high officers he was a great favourite. His manner to them
was a marvel&mdash;so dignified, as well as respectful. Give
Will a chance of shining, and he always shone, and I loved
him from the day he came on board. Will Hardres always
seemed to me to be the grandest man I ever knew. I am
sure I expected him to be a greater man than the Admiral
himself some day. His mother brought him up in certain
principles. He was too proud to be tempted from them,
too courageous to be daunted from them. I do not think
he was much above the average in strength or activity
but I never saw such courage in any man except the
Admiral. With the other mids, some of them little boys,
he was not likely to have much in sympathy. He was a
good deal older than most midshipmen, and big for his age,
and, so far as habits were concerned, the difference was
still greater.</p>

<p>The junior lieutenants, on the other hand, disliked his
haughtiness and self-assurance, though they all of them saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
that he had corresponding courage. By all rights they
should have patronised him, but he could much more
properly patronise them. The climax, of course, was the
Admiral&rsquo;s very marked favour. But this signified less by
the fact that he dined at the Admiral&rsquo;s table, and was in
almost constant attendance on his person.</p>

<p>I shall let you know how Will first made his mark.
One summer morning, July 19th, 1798, as I remember it,
we found ourselves off Syracuse. It was not the first time,
either, during our long chase after the French, so we all
knew the place well by sight.</p>

<p>We could make out the old castle of Maniace, eight
hundred years old, they say, standing at the end of the
island of Ortygia; if it had not been for the great high walls
stopping there, we should never have known where this
island left off. And we could make out the opposite shore
with its low cliffs, where the Athenians would have been
safe if they could have reached it, as the chaplain explained
to us mids last time we sighted the place. The Admiral
was very busy with his glass, and Captain Berry was standing
by him with some reports, which seemed to trouble him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Berry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we are short of
nearly everything. But this question of running out of
water is a serious one. We must see to that. There are
polacres in the Little Port, I see, and we could hire or even
impress them to bring off water and supplies; but could we
tranship with this sea on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do anything, sir; but I think it will be very
difficult and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Great Port, Berry, I read in the <i>Mirror</i>, that
though it was one of the most famous ports of antiquity,
it has been too silted up for large ships of the last few
centuries to be able to enter it, though the water inside
is in places too deep for the best anchorage. There is a
footnote which says the passage is so well known to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
impossible, that it is never attempted. Now, Berry, it is
equally well known that in the course of centuries channels
change, and I shall try it. Of course, we shall take the
utmost care, and at the worst only one vessel can strike;
and we have force enough to haul her off. I shall lead
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is useless to ask if there is any need for this,
sir; but it would be so bad for the fleet if anything should
happen to your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our ship, Berry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Troubridge, sir, every captain in the fleet,
would volunteer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my post where there is risk: I shall try it. Head
the ship for the opening, and signal to the fleet to prepare
to follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain stepped away to give the necessary orders.
I felt rooted to the spot, where I had been standing, just
within earshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, youngster,&rdquo; called the Admiral, &ldquo;come and see
a bit of navigation that may go down in the annals of the
Navy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a matter of ancient history now, how the <i>Vanguard</i>
sailed in without a check. We did not have one anxious
sounding as we swept round and brought up abreast of the
Marina, just opposite the cathedral, which used to be the
Temple of somebody, and has half its columns outside and
the other half inside, doing duty as the pillars of an aisle.
The Marina is a sort of carriage drive dividing the landing
quays from the ancient wall, which in other parts is washed
by the sea itself. It is handsomely laid out with shade-trees
and flowers, and at one end terminated by the
natural rocks from which rushes the famous Fountain of
Arethusa. This pleased the Admiral extravagantly. He
said several times: &ldquo;I shall water my ships at the Fountain
of Arethusa, and then Fortune cannot fail to smile upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
We brought up in beautiful order, with our larboard
resting on a shore with ruins all along the horizon, which
the chaplain told us formed four-fifths of the city in the
ancient times. The island of Ortygia, which is occupied
by the present city, was the smallest of the five quarters.
On the sky-line was the Castle of Euryalus, which might
have been a medi&aelig;val fortress, with its fine square towers
and high curtain wall, though it was built by the Athenians
in the famous siege. Our starboard ran up to the entrance
of the port, under the Castle of Maniace.</p>

<p>As we were running in, the flag was hoisted on the
Castle, to which we replied by showing English colours.
Almost at the same time a boat came aboard with the
Captain of the Port and an Adjutant of the town to offer us
any refreshments of which we might be in need, and to
point out that it would not be necessary for us to lose
the wind by entering the harbour, for that they could be
brought to us as we lay off. But since the Admiral would
not listen to him, and held straight on, a second boat
boarded us soon after, this time with the Town Major and
the Second Commandant of Artillery to confer with the
Admiral, repeating the compliments and offers of assistance,
and at the same time acquainting him that the Governor&rsquo;s
orders and instructions prevented his admitting into the
harbour more than three or four ships at one time, even
though they should belong to an allied and friendly power,
as the English nation was. But the Admiral having a
Royal letter with orders that the whole squadron should be
admitted, proceeded to enter the harbour without waiting,
and anchored, as I have said.</p>

<p>No sooner had we let go the anchor than the Admiral
hailed Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will,&rdquo; he said (he always called him Will), &ldquo;ask Mr.
Comyn to come to me. I believe he knows a little Italian,
and I take it that the Governor will be able to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
Italian as well as Sicilian, though one never knows. These
Sicilian magnificoes, though their language is no better than
a dialect of Italian, make it a point of honour not to know
the mother-language, and hate the people on the mainland
better than any one in Europe. However, Comyn can talk
a little French too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may interrupt, sir,&rdquo; said Will, &ldquo;I can speak both
languages very well. My mother&rdquo;&mdash;here he blushed&mdash;&ldquo;could
not afford me any better schooling than I could have
at the village school and of the Rector. But she did her
best to make up for it by teaching me these languages.
She was brought up in these countries; my father married
her while he was serving in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said the Admiral. &ldquo;I do not like employing
a black coat on these occasions, especially in a priest-ridden
country like this, where the bare sight of a Protestant clergyman
fills them with envy, hatred, and malice, because they
are no longer able to Inquisition him and burn him. Will,
I must promote you lieutenant; we can rig you out from
Vassall&rsquo;s sea-chest&mdash;he&rsquo;s about your build: we could hardly
send a midshipman on an affair of this sort. And you shall
go ashore in my barge, so as to observe ceremony. When
you get there, demand to be taken with your guard to the
Governor, and when you see him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He turned round
to me with more coldness than I thought necessary, and
said, &ldquo;You can leave us, Trinder, and ask the Captain,
with my compliments, if he will order my barge to be
lowered and manned, with a guard of marines for the
officer carrying despatches. And ask Mr. Vassall to come
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shall never forget Will as he was rowed away from the
flagship, sitting in the stern-sheets of the Admiral&rsquo;s barge.
Vassall&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;it was his best full-dress parade uniform,
and he was richer than most of us, being the son of a
wealthy Jamaica planter and careful of his appearance&mdash;well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
his uniform fitted Will almost as trimly as if it had
been made for him; and there Will sat, with that fair,
proud face of his, which I would back against the Apollo
Belvedere, though I have never seen it, set as stern as a
statue&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The Admiral himself could not have had it written in
his features more plainly that he had the guns of the
squadron behind him&mdash;a fine squadron, with which we
hoped to break up the French fleet and capture the convoy
with &ldquo;Bony&rdquo; and all his army on board. There Will sat,
as if there were no one in the barge with him&mdash;no sea, no
land, no walls between him and the Governor of Syracuse.
And as the barge sheered off I caught the Admiral&rsquo;s eye
looking at him. What would not Sir Horatio have given
to have had such a son?</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span>&mdash;In which Will
has his first Chance, and his first
Escapade, and his first Meeting
with the Princess of Favara.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> SHOULD have said that ten minutes before the barge
left, the Admiral hailed me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and make yourself ready, Trinder. Mr.
Hardres must not steer the barge now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so I went with him. But though I was his particular
mate, and never away from him for five minutes when
he was not with the Admiral, he took no more account of
me than any common seaman. He seemed wrapt up in
his mission, and I saw that he had the Admiral&rsquo;s great
quality of not letting an opportunity pass.</p>

<p>When we reached the long landing steps under the
Marina, we were met by a ragged rabble of a guard under
an officer who spoke French. Now, I knew a very little
of French, and could make out that Will demanded to be
taken at once into the presence of the Governor, with myself
and his guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, Monsieur the Vice-Admiral,&rdquo; said the officer with
the greatest possible alacrity.</p>

<p>Like every one else in the city, he was bursting to know
the reason of the advent of this formidable fleet. England
was at peace with the Two Sicilies, he knew. So, for the
matter of that, was France; though all the time his King,
and, what was more to the point, his Queen, were dying to
cut the throat of every Frenchman, and ready to declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
war the moment they could get sufficient protection from
the Allies. In the state of confusion Europe was then in
no one would have been surprised at any of the belligerents
seizing any point of vantage they happened to require, in
the territories of the feeble principalities of Italy. The
townspeople, mad with delight, imagined that this fine fleet
had come to occupy Syracuse, and defend it against the
dreaded operations of the French. So delighted were they
to see us, that the Governor wrote afterwards to Sir John
Acton, that they would have carried the ships one by one
to their houses, if it had been possible. And in any case
resistance would have been impossible. For centuries it
had been the cardinal belief that no large ship could cross
the bar at the entrance to the Great Port. Consequently,
the inner face of the city all along the Marina was hardly
fortified; certainly not in a state to resist any kind of naval
attack more formidable than an assault by boats. A frigate
could have defied the landward guns of the Castle, and laid
the town in ashes. If the Syracusans had not been too
ignorant to know anything about the political questions with
which Europe was boiling, they might have thought that the
English had come there to seize the town, because the Two
Sicilies had not declared war upon the French. That the
town was about to be seized upon some pretext or other,
they felt certain; else why this imposing force&mdash;the
greatest expedition which had ever come to the city since
the famous siege by the Athenians? And the Athenians,
God bless them, came before the days of gunpowder.</p>

<p>The officer, forming his ragged troops in some sort of
order, led the way to the ancient castello, built by the Greek,
Georgio Maniace, when he reconquered Syracuse from the
Arabs, before the Norman conquest. A lovely, but rather
tumbledown black-and-white marble gateway had been
built by him to support the two famous bronze rams, made
by ancient Greeks in classical times. Seven hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
seventy years afterwards the gate and its rams were still
there to give our entry becoming state. The rams were
really very comical, and I had it just on my lips, when I
caught Will&rsquo;s hard blue eye, and brought my face to attention.
Nor was that the only comical thing about the castle,
which was so little used that a fine crop of dwarf stocks
were growing right up to the guns.</p>

<p>The Governor, Don Giuseppe delle Torre, had chosen
rather an <i>al fresco</i> scene for the reception.</p>

<p>To be brief, he had had a space cleared among the
powder and shot and flour barrels in the deep bomb-proof
vaults, which are a feature of fortresses in these parts.
There was hardly any light, and there were only three
chairs, two of which he hastily assigned to us. I noticed
that a bed, with very fine but much-worn Spanish hangings,
was being erected in one corner; and I wondered if, as the
next move, he would not have the powder taken out and
thrown into the sea. In which he would have shown his
wisdom, as the castle could not possibly have made any
resistance to our fleet, and it might have blown up if a
chance shot had found its way into the magazine.</p>

<p>Also, I wondered if Will was noticing all these comical
details, and looked at him. The icy contempt on his face
showed that he had taken the Governor&rsquo;s measure.</p>

<p>When we had been bowed into our seats, the Governor
bowed again and waited for Will to begin.</p>

<p>Generally the stronger waits for the weaker, but in this
case the explanation could only come from us. Will began
by inquiring, could his Excellency speak Italian? His
Excellency, for a wonder, knew what was nominally his
native language. Will came to the point at once. He
presented the Royal despatch, written in the name of His
Majesty, and signed by the Captain-General, the Chevalier
Acton, enjoining the Governor in the most pressing manner
to welcome and admit the English squadron, going beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
what is usual, and mentioning many novel and unexpected
possibilities by reason of His Majesty&rsquo;s good-will and friendship
towards the English nation.</p>

<p>Would his Excellency, then, give the proper orders for
the fleet of his High and Mighty Majesty, the King of Great
Britain and Ireland, to be supplied at a proper price with
such water and other stores as it might need?</p>

<p>His Excellency&rsquo;s face fell. Then, noticing Will&rsquo;s youth,
he began a long and specious apology. His High and
Mighty Majesty, the King of Great Britain and Ireland, was,
he admitted, a very good friend of his August Majesty the
King of the Two Sicilies; but in order to prevent a French
fleet being quartered upon him, his August Majesty the
King of the Two Sicilies had been compelled to enter into a
compact not to admit more than three or four ships of any
nation into any of his ports at one time. At the same time
the French declared that they would treat it as an act of war
if any nation at war with them (meaning, of course, us) was
allowed to take in supplies in his August Majesty&rsquo;s ports.
He would therefore be unable to accede to the request,
much as he desired to do anything for the great Admiral
Nelson, the good friend of his country. Would the Illustrissimo
Vice-Admiral convey to the Admiral his most profound
and heartfelt apologies for not being able to comply?
For himself, he must again say that, if only he were able,
it would give him the deepest gratification, and so on and
so on.</p>

<p>There was a look of unmitigated scorn on Will&rsquo;s fine
face. He did not believe one word that the Don was
saying, and waited with diplomatic impatience, formally
restrained but clearly hinted, until the Governor had
finished; when he replied in cold, calm tones that the
Governor had here orders from his Sovereign, countersigned
by the Chevalier Acton, superseding all general
orders, and directing him to act as Admiral Nelson might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
wish. The Governor stoutly maintained that the despatch
gave no instructions about the admission of the entire
squadron; whereas we, through the good Lady Hamilton,
by whose influence they had been procured for us, knew
positively that this was intended. And here, perhaps,
Will&rsquo;s diplomacy failed him, for he had such a contempt
for the whole nation, that he could not but consider the
possibility of further secret orders having been issued that
the Royal despatch, overriding the general policy of the
country, should itself be ignored. He did not know then&mdash;in
fact none of us, from the Admiral downward, did
know&mdash;how completely Ferdinand gave over politics to
his imperious spouse in order to be allowed to devote
himself to the pleasures of the chase, the pleasures of
the table, and intrigues of a non-political kind.</p>

<p>In brief, the Governor refused to allow us to take in
water or stores of any kind until we withdrew our
squadron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Will, looking positively majestic as he
felt himself the mouthpiece of his country, &ldquo;I have the
honour to present your Excellency with the schedule of the
Admiral&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo; This with a deep bow. And,
with another deep bow, &ldquo;I have the honour to inform
your Excellency that if permission for their supply is not
sent on board within twelve hours, the Admiral is prepared
to enforce his requirements with the guns of his ships. I
have the honour to wish your Excellency,&rdquo; this with a still
deeper bow, &ldquo;a very good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay! stay! not so fast, Illustrissimo. Would you
graciously write down this cartel, so that I may make no
mistake? Ah, you have been reading it!&rdquo; he said, catching
sight of a second scroll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid this will not do. It is in English&mdash;the
Admiral&rsquo;s note of the words I should use for the manifesto.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
&ldquo;And you assure me that what you have said is the
exact translation of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put into the roundabout and compliment-paying
phrases which your language demands&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is quite sufficient, Illustrissimo. Tell your
terrible Admiral that he will not have to fire his guns into
us; that I shall be rejoiced from the bottom of my heart to
supply him with whatever he requires, water, provisions,
powder even, at the most reasonable prices. With this
piece of paper in my hands, I have only yielded to force.
His August Majesty will not declare war upon his High
and Mighty Majesty for this breach of the peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he added to himself, as we learned from the ladies
of his party on the next evening, that he did not feel
so certain that France would not regard it as an act
of war.</p>

<p>This whole affair of Syracuse has not even yet been
cleared up, and it must be remembered that I am writing
a good many years after the event. To this day the
Admiralty is in the dark as to whether the Governor did
receive secret orders, overriding the Royal despatch, and
supposing he did, if it formed part of those orders that
he was to yield, but only to yield to a pretence of force.
One thing is quite certain&mdash;that, as soon as force was
mentioned, he showed the greatest good-will; and the
Admiral wrote in two separate letters to Sir William and
Lady Hamilton, both written the day before he left: &ldquo;I
have no complaint to make of private attention. Every
body of persons have been on board to offer me civilities.&rdquo;
And in the other letter: &ldquo;My dear friends, thanks to your
exertions we have victualled and watered; and surely,
watering at the fountain of Arethusa, we must have victory.
We shall sail with the first breeze; and, be assured, I will
return either crowned with laurel or covered with cypress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards the breeze did come in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
afternoon, as it always does at Syracuse. In the morning
the Admiral wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fleet is unmoored, and the moment the wind comes
off the land, we shall go out of the delightful harbour,
where our present wants have been most amply supplied,
and where every attention had been paid to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I am anticipating. The Governor was as good as
his word, and we were soon in the thick of taking in stores
and water; and as there was no hope of going out in less
than two days at the earliest, the inhabitants began to
organise a round of hospitalities.</p>

<p>The very next evening, the Governor, who had recovered
so far from his fright of our cannon as to have his state bed
moved back from the subterranean magazine of the castle,
gave a ball in our honour at his palace. The Admiral had
in the afternoon paid him a state visit, accompanied by his
staff.</p>

<p>To the English it might sound a formidable undertaking
to ask the officers of a whole fleet to a ball at a few hours&rsquo;
notice, but in Sicily it is very different. The palaces of
the nobles were built, many of them, in the Middle Ages,
when it was necessary to house the retainers, who were,
in fact, the nobleman&rsquo;s army, within the walls of his town
palace when he happened to be there, as much as it was
necessary to house them within the walls of his castle
when he was in the country on his estates. When the
custom of each noble maintaining a private army died out,
their palaces were naturally a great deal larger than they
required for their diminished establishments, and each
palace could afford to have noble suites of entertaining
rooms not used at ordinary times, but ready, with a little
taking off of covers, for any <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, like a ball at carnival
time. As most nobles grew their own wine, they had
an unlimited supply maturing in their cellars, and fruit
in Sicily is as a drug in the market. There remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
nothing, therefore, but for the ladies to bring out their
gala dresses from their chests, and to summon all the
banquet-cooks in Syracuse to the Governor&rsquo;s kitchen.</p>

<p>I must say that we were received with very great
ceremony, for though they were of an old-fashioned style
and sadly needed freshening up, a plentiful supply of
private coaches met us at the landing steps, and drove
us along the Marina, and up through the sea-gate to the
Governor&rsquo;s palace, which was situated in the main street
near the centre of the town. It was quite light when we
drove in through the lofty gateway, under the great
Spanish balcony of heavy ironwork bulging out like the
bows of a first-rate, and ornamented at the ends with
splendid hammered-iron roses. Once through the gateway
we found ourselves in a courtyard, round which the
palace was built. At the far end was a wide sweeping
stone outside-stairway, with a heavy stone parapet, which
went almost round two sides of the court. On the post
at the bottom end of the parapet was seated a queer lion,
carved out of the post itself at some time during the
Middle Ages. This stairway, and the terrace which led
from it into the principal apartments, were strewn with
rich carpets of very ancient date, but more out of repair
than any gentleman would use in England. The rooms
inside, too, reminded me more of an English nobleman&rsquo;s
seat which was never used by its owner, but maintained
in its ancient condition as a show place; for the silk
hangings of the walls were broken or threadbare in places,
and the carpets, likewise ancient, were in the like state.
And though chandeliers of rock-crystal hung in all the
state rooms, and we saw fine old cabinets here and
there, there did not seem to be a good new piece in the
whole establishment, and the servants, whose name was
legion, were as dilapidated as the hangings.</p>

<p>The dresses of the ladies, too, were not such as we saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
at Palermo, when the King and Queen were holding their
Court there after the flight from Naples; but, while made
of most valuable brocades, they had the appearance of
being used for a lifetime on the rare occasions on which
they were required. The ball consisted largely of eating
the fine fruits and drinking the good Sicilian wines, both
of which were very welcome in a Sicilian July, after a
long spell at sea. For but few of the English officers and
the Sicilian ladies were able to dance sufficiently well
together, and it seemed not to be etiquette for the Sicilian
gentlemen to be dancing while any English officers were
without partners.</p>

<p>The few officers who spoke the language of the country
conversed with the younger ladies, who never moved from
the sides of their mothers, except to dance; and as the
music was of the poorest order, the proceedings were
sufficiently doleful. But I must say that Will, as I
afterwards found was his invariable fortune, fell upon
his feet.</p>

<p>He was attending the Admiral, who was, of course,
conversing with the Governor, who even in the midst of
the festivities would from time to time try and extract a
promise from the Admiral to withdraw his ships. The
conversation was through the interpretations of Will and
the chaplain; and by the Governor was standing a young
girl attended by a brother in place of a mother. I may say
at once that she was of extraordinary beauty: somewhat
tall and slender, distinguished to an unusual degree by the
singular grace of figure and carriage characteristic of young
Sicilian women. Her hair, which waved beautifully, was
dusky rather than dark; and a dusky complexion, almost
transparent in its purity, was thrown up by the wonderful
Sicilian eyes, which are not brown, but of a very dark
grey, looking blue in some lights and black in others;
while the note of delicate refinement suggested by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
slight, beautifully carried figure, was maintained by the
delicacy of the thin nose of classical straightness, and the
thin mouth.</p>

<p>Thin mouths are ordinarily taken to be typical of cruelty,
but this by no means exhausts the category. There is
another kind of thin lips typical of sensibility, and yet
another typical of passion, to some degree of animal
passion, but more of an intense ardour of devotion. Donna
Rusidda&rsquo;s lips had both these last two elements in them.
Devotion and extreme sensibility mingled curiously with
the archness of her face.</p>

<p>Donna Rosalia<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (or Rusidda) di Mardolce and her brother
Don Ruggiero, who was the Prince of Favara, were
Palermitans. They lived in the old half-Arabic palace of
the Favara, which was the great Emperor Frederick II.&rsquo;s
favourite summer residence, and which had come down
to them through many generations. But they were connected
with Syracuse through their mother, who belonged
to the ancient family of the Mont&rsquo; alti. The palace of the
Mont&rsquo; alti, which we saw the next day, must, when it was
built, four hundred years ago, have been one of the most
beautiful in Syracuse. The Gothic windows, rather in the
Venetian style, of its upper storey have an Arabic delicacy
and airiness. But in our day quite a mean street had
grown up about it, and the last of the Mont&rsquo; alti, the widower
uncle with whom the young Prince and his sister were
staying, lived in a mere corner of his palace, only able to
maintain his rusty equipages by practising the strictest
economy in every other way. People prophesied that
these, too, would go soon, and the last of the Mont&rsquo; alti of
Milocca, the proudest barons of Syracuse in the Middle
Ages, seek death by his own hand, when he could no
longer afford the last poor appurtenances of his rank.</p>

Rosalia is pronounced R&#333;s&#259;-l&#275;&#259;. Rusidda is a pet abbreviation
of it.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
However, I shall have little more to say of him: he only
comes into my chronicle because &ldquo;Rusidda Favara,&rdquo; as she
was generally called, was staying under his roof when
she and Will met.</p>

<p>How far Will admired her I could not tell. There were
only certain moods which were easily reflected in his face,
such as anger and scorn. He had more than the ordinary
English resolution to conceal his gentler moods. Except
when he was annoyed, his hard, handsome face was almost
inscrutable. He certainly talked to her and her brother
a good deal; they had been at the Neapolitan Court much
in their richer days, and spoke Italian fluently. During
the conversation she seems to have told Will about the
windows of her room, the beautiful Arab-Gothic windows
which I was mentioning&mdash;a conversation which was shortly
to show my young sir in a new light. The function did
not last late; indeed, it dragged along somewhat too mournfully
for that, and we rowed back to our respective ships.</p>

<p>I had not been asleep a great while&mdash;I cannot say for
certain how long&mdash;when I heard my door open, and some
one came in with a subdued &ldquo;H&rsquo;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recognised Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tubby,&rdquo; he whispered, coming up to my bunk, &ldquo;will
you come with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would have gone with Will to the devil, so I made no
conditions, but rose and began to put my things on. I only
whispered one word&mdash;&ldquo;Ashore?&rdquo; I felt certain that it was
so, because there was nothing else to rise for in this secret
fashion, except a practical jest, and Will was the last man
in the world to play a practical jest on a brother officer.
His aloofness was their principal complaint against him,
and but for his fierce temper and remarkable courage he
might have been thought young-ladyish, so unlike was
he to the ordinary roystering young naval officer of that
piping time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
I did not even ask how we were to get ashore, I concluded
that Will had seen to that; and I knew that our
getting away depended on our not being overheard, so kept
silence. Will crept stealthily, I following, to the starboard
shrouds of the mizzen. Then he slipped over the side into
the mizzen chains, whispering as he went, &ldquo;Stop in the
chains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had, I observed, a coil of rope with him. Nothing
happened for a little while. I supposed that there was
some boat that he was looking for, and kept as still as a
mouse. Apparently he saw nothing, but presently he took
a piece of phosphorus out of his pocket and rubbed the
sole of his foot. So he told me afterwards, for I only saw a
bit of something shining. He chose this part because if
the watch came along and peeped over he had only to set
his foot down. Directly afterwards I heard a low, muffled
sound, and a boat slid almost noiselessly beneath us.
Will made fast one end of his rope to the shrouds, and
knotted a loop in the rope at a distance as far as he could
judge of about five feet from the water, whispering to me
to follow if he made a certain signal. The loop was, of
course, to enable him to stop if the boat was not all right.
We both had our shoes hung round our necks so that we
could walk the more silently. I found myself in the high-peaked
bow of one of the little boats which all Italians call
a <i>barca</i>. The boatmen pulled us to the landing steps very
quickly and very quietly. There was a sentry there, but
fortunately he was one of the guard who had escorted us
to the Governor in the morning. He challenged, Will said
something to him, and the man recognised him as the
&ldquo;Vice-Admiral&rdquo; who had arrived in the Admiral&rsquo;s barge in
the morning. And as his countrymen seldom did important
business without some passing of secret messages, he took
it that Will bore some such secret communication between
the Admiral and the Governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
The boatman, I observed by the light of the sentry&rsquo;s
wretched lamp&mdash;a little flat earthenware vessel with a hole
in the top, through which some strands of cotton found
their way into the oil&mdash;had left his <i>barca</i> and was
accompanying us, carrying a mysterious bundle.</p>

<p>We had, of course, put on our shoes in the boat. The
man led the way. As soon as we were out of sight of the
sentry Will followed close at his heels, and I, who had not
the smallest knowledge of what we were to do, unless it
were to have a knife put into us in this evil-looking,
cut-throat city, kept close to Will, you may be sure. First
he led us to a place where we had to climb the city wall,
which was not kept too well mended or guarded, on the
side towards the Great Harbour. The man went first and
drew his bundle up after him by a line which he seemed
to have brought for the purpose. We followed, and then
went through a very network of narrow, black, winding
streets, with great doors every few yards, out of every one
of which I expected some one to spring upon us, not very
much caring, because after all, I remembered that it was
my profession to be killed. At last we crossed a big, open
space, and, taking one or two turns more through narrow
lanes, came to a great house standing up gaunt and black
against the sky, which was clear and starlit, though there
was no moon.</p>

<p>As we went along, having no longer any necessity for
silence, Will had unfolded his intention to me, and it fairly
took away my breath. Indeed, I did not believe that he
would put it into execution. But when he came to the great
house which was our destination, taking the bundle from
the boatman, he unwrapped a stringed instrument, a sort
of lute or zither it seemed to me. I waited to see him
assemble the passers-by. In Sicily people seem hardly to
go to bed all night in the summer. And even more I expected
the fortress-like gates of the palace to open and some one to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
rush out. But nothing of the kind happened. The passers-by
smiled, and the gates of the palace remained as sealed
as if they never would open until the day of judgment.</p>

<p>Will had, in the meantime, struck up a tinkly little
tune&mdash;he was evidently familiar with the instrument&mdash;with
some Italian words which I did not understand, but took
to be a serenade. He had a fair voice and played well
enough. After a while I let go of the handle of my dirk
which I had brought with me and gripped ready to strike.
Will went on singing.</p>

<p>As my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I made
out that the palace under which we stood had the beautiful
moresco windows high up on its front which identified it
as the palace of the Mont&rsquo; alti, concerning which Will had
told me&mdash;the palace where Donna Rusidda was visiting
with her uncle.</p>

<p>Will sang on, and presently the shutter of one of these
windows was opened just a chink, and a ray of light
stabbed the darkness.</p>

<p>Will sang on, and the opening widened gradually, revealing
first a hand and then the graceful head of Donna Rusidda;
and finally she flung the shutters right back and stood in
full view at the window, inclining graciously. Will sang
one or two more songs, and then, making a very fine salute,
and bowing, put his lute or zither under his arm and joined
me where I was standing in the shadow. The zither was
duly wrapped up again by the light of a flickering oil lamp
which hung under a much venerated image of the Virgin
and Child let into the wall of the Piazza, the open space
which I have mentioned as being close to the palace. The
boatman then led the way back to his <i>barca</i>, and rowed us
swiftly and silently out to the flagship, under the starboard
mizzen chains, where we found our rope still hanging.
We then took our shoes off and tied them together and
hung them round our necks, and Will made the boatman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
a liberal present, which I dare swear took a month&rsquo;s
money from his pocket.</p>

<p>Creeping very cautiously, we reached our bunks without
detection, and I turned round and went to sleep, thinking
that Master Will had had monstrous little play for his
money.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span>&mdash;At the Fountain
of Cyan&eacute; and the Papyrus Beds
of the Anapo.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the next day, having taken in all manner of supplies
to our complete satisfaction, and there not being
wind enough to take us out, as was too obvious
even for the Governor to protest, the Admiral expressed
his desire to see the remains of ancient Syracuse, more
particularly those parts connected with the siege, and the
surrender of the Athenians, which last shocked him very
much. &ldquo;To surrender,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to lose all your men
and none of the enemy&rsquo;s, to give him much larger stores
of arms and ammunition. To surrender is shameful; to
die fighting against insuperable odds is the finest kind of
death. If those Athenians had gone on fighting their
way, though it might have cost the Syracusans only one
man for their two, or one man for their three, depend
upon it some of them would have got through to the friendly
city of Catania.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
Catana was the ancient name.</p>
</div>

<p>In the morning the Governor had arranged that we were
to visit the river Anapo, the only place, it is said, where the
papyrus used for the books of antiquity continues to grow in
a natural state, taking on our way the few stones which mark
the position near which the Athenians met their last defeat.</p>

<p>We had to rise betimes to do this, but the Governor
explained that at Syracuse there was always what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
called a little storm in the afternoon. The Admiral replied
that he did not imagine that any storm which they could
have in that bay would be like to frighten his Majesty&rsquo;s
sailors, but if it came he should be glad to oblige the
Governor by sailing out on it to get a day nearer to those
rascally French.</p>

<p>Quite early in the morning, before one breakfasts in
England, we rowed across the Great Port in the Admiral&rsquo;s
barge to the low-lying mouth of the river. The Admiral
made me coxswain for the day, out of the goodness of his
heart, I know, that Will should have a companion. We
could not enter the river for a bar with only a few inches
of water on it; but we were met by a very comical sight,
for no sooner had we grounded a few feet off the land than
a mounted orderly came on board. He had on enormous
top boots and spurs, and a kind of sabre a great deal too
large for him, and he was all belts, and had on his head
the most wonderful kind of ancient Roman helmet, with a
huge brass cockscomb and the most extravagant plumes of
horsehair I have ever seen, calling to mind the pictures
of Sir William Johnson&rsquo;s Indian braves during the late
war in America. But for all this he was mounted, not
on his horse, which he might very well have ridden out
to us, but sitting a-straddle on the left shoulder of a tall
fisherman, who threw him aboard with so little ceremony
that, if he had not been caught by our men, he would
surely have fallen over his sabre and broken it.</p>

<p>He pointed out on the shore a number of lumbering
coaches, the upper parts of which were mostly all glass.
Some of these, he told us, were empty, and for us, because
the part of the river below the ancient bridge (which the
chaplain said was built by the Athenians) had become
too choked even for the river boats, which were to meet
us at that point. It being summer, he assured us that
the coaches would not become quagmired in doing this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
journey, which was only so many hundred yards. The
Governor, it appeared, did not like salt water well enough
to adventure the row across the bay, but had driven round
in his coach. There were fishermen ready, he said in
conclusion, to carry the English officers ashore.</p>

<p>After asking the Admiral&rsquo;s leave, he then made signs, and
one of the inarticulate noises with which the Italians express
much; and a number of fishermen, pretty well naked
except for their short shirts and hanging red caps, rushed
into the water to the side of the barge. But our English
seamen were too quick for them, and, leaping overboard,
carried the Admiral and the captains who were with him in
true English humper-back style, though Will obtained the
Admiral&rsquo;s permission for him and me to try this queer
shoulder-riding, which is not to be commended above once.</p>

<p>We noticed that the officer who had come out to the
Admiral from the Governor, remounted with trepidation.
No sooner were we ashore than the Governor, with his
principal officers, stepping down from their coaches,
advanced to meet us with bows which took us some
trouble to return with sufficient stooping. We feared to
heel over. They had a party of ladies with them, as we
could see, though we were not presented to them until
we reached the boats which were to take us up the river.</p>

<p>Before we started, the Governor asked us if we would
make a slight detour now to see the Temple of Jupiter,
which the Admiral had mentioned as one of the spots
he desired most to investigate. The Admiral said that
he was in the Governor&rsquo;s hands, and the coaches therefore
turned off along what they call a road in Sicily, but which
is no better than a ploughed field. Our officer with the
plumes, who seemed a good fellow, assured Will and
myself, who were with him of the party in the first coach,
that this was a good country road, and that we were
fortunate in not having to bump over broken rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
When we came up with the ladies, I must say we
were most agreeably astonished, for the boats, which had
the same high noses as the <i>barca</i> in which Will and I
had adventured the night before, only were in every way
lighter and longer, were spread with rich cloths, and had
fine silken canopies. The ladies, too, being no longer in
their ancestral state dresses, but in robes of thin silk,
mostly the thin white which the Italians know so well
how to wear, were a most beautiful sight, for they were all
young, and might have been chosen for their appearance.</p>

<p>Among the number was Donna Rusidda, and it was
arranged, with evident design, that Will should have a
place by her.</p>

<p>Seldom have I seen so gracious a sight as that procession
presented.</p>

<p>I took particular note of this when we reached the first
bed of the Egyptian papyrus, which grows somewhat after
the manner of the palmetto, with branching stems, tufted at
the tops. But there is this difference between it and the
palmetto&mdash;that its leaves, instead of being papery, are like
horses&rsquo; tails, made of the greenest grass, each blade being
as round as twine. They make a pleasant whispering
noise, if there is a wind ever so light, and they are five, ten,
and fifteen feet high. There is a bend in the river where
the bed begins, so I caught sight of the next <i>barca</i> almost
broadside, as she swung round; and the effect was, I say,
very beautiful, for their deck cloths and their silk canopies
were of the Governor&rsquo;s colours, crimson edged with silver
and very rich facings, and these contrasted with the green
of the papyrus on the banks, which almost arched over our
heads, so narrow was the waterway. And I am sure that,
to those in the other <i>barcas</i>, the contrast of the white
dresses of the ladies and the bright blue uniforms of His
Majesty&rsquo;s officers, made a splendid bouquet of colour.</p>

<p>The Admiral sat with the Governor on a kind of little dais
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
raised on the stern, the like of which the other boats had
not. Mr. Comyn was no longer with him for interpreting,
since Thucydides tells us nothing about <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> on the Anapo
with court ladies. He was learned in the classics, Mr.
Comyn, and the Admiral was always much interested to hear
what the classics had to say about this or the other spot,
famous in Greek or Roman history, when we came to it.
The Admiral and the Governor were surrounded by the
most beautiful of the ladies, Will sitting close to the
Admiral&rsquo;s right hand to interpret, as occasion arose, and with
Donna Rusidda on his right hand. She looked as beautiful
as an angel in her filmy white robes, which brought out
the marvellous clearness of her cheeks and the soulfulness of
her eyes. Moreover, leaning against the cushioned side of
a boat is a test whether a lady have grace or not, in which
she came out uncommon well.</p>

<p>The Admiral was in high spirits, leaning out of the boat
to try and gather a papyrus stalk (it was from the stalk that
the ancients got their paper), and laughing like a boy when
his arm, in its best State uniform, was dragged under water.
Presently he spied with that eye of his, which took in
every object of a view at a single glance, a fine green
and blue lizard sitting on a papyrus stalk outlined against
the sky. The chaplain, who was in the middle of the boat,
would have it&mdash;I know not if he was right&mdash;that this was
the famous chameleon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him, Trinder,&rdquo; said the Admiral, and I made up
my mind to have him if I had to tumble into the water for
it (it was good weather for dipping in); but the boatman,
seeing what I was going to do, knocked the stalk away with
his oar, jabbering like a monkey, and my lizard was gone.
The Governor spoke to him sharply in Sicilian, and turning
to Will, made a long apology in Italian for him to translate
to the Admiral, which was to the effect that this lizard had
the evil eye, or something of the sort, and it was most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
unlucky to anger it. The Admiral gave one of his hearty
laughs, and the incident passed off; but presently, as we
were passing right through a thick tuft, Will said to me,
&ldquo;There is another: you catch him. I&rsquo;ll stop the boatman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The long <i>barca</i> glided swishing under the overhanging
papyrus to where the great lizard lay shamming sleep
against the stalk. The boatman saw us looking, and raised
his oar again. Quick as lightning, Will caught it, and was
ready to strike the man or seize him by the throat as
occasion was; but another person had seen it, and a stern
voice came from the dais&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Hardres!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will looked back, still holding the oar. The Admiral did
not use this name in ordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to carry any ill fortune with us while
we are trying to fight the French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will dropped the oar and saluted; and the Admiral,
smiling again, said we might not be able to get enough
wind even to frighten the Governor, with the chaplain&rsquo;s
chameleon on board. But Donna Rusidda arched her eyebrows
and said to Will,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We of the Favara have lasted six centuries, and we
have always defied Fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which Will replied, &ldquo;Don Comyn there, our <i>padre</i>, as
you would call him, says he believes the Admiral is like the
Roman Sylla&mdash;that there is no name by which he would
so gladly be called as Faustus, the favourite of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were not over long in the river Anapo, I believe,
because the Governor would have us see the fountain of
Cyan&eacute;, from which the river named after it, the Cyano,
derives its clear, plentiful water. The tributary was
decidedly deeper than the river, and here and there the
overarching clumps&mdash;I might almost speak of them as an
avenue, for they sometimes met above our heads&mdash;broke off
for a while, and the banks would be bordered with sedges
of the leaves of the yellow iris, which blossoms here in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
abundance in the spring. So Donna Rusidda informed
Will. We quite missed the rustle of the papyrus against
our canopy when we came to these open spots, though I
daresay the boatmen were glad enough, for they must have
impeded the way of the boat very much.</p>

<p>The fountain was no great distance up&mdash;perhaps a mile or
so, and it certainly was a natural curiosity. It was the shape
of the bowl of an egg-cup, and the Governor claimed that it
was fifty feet deep; and I dare swear it was over thirty,
though one could see every pebble on the bottom, and see
great mullet, looking quite blue, at what they considered a
safe depth from the attentions of man. It was curious to
see these sea fish running up to half a dozen pounds&rsquo; weight
so far from the sea, in water fresh from the fountain head,
and icy cold. I was rather thankful that Will had his
Donna Rusidda beside him, for he would have been itching
to slip out of his clothes somehow, and dive for the stones,
which looked like turquoises, at the bottom of the spring.
The prospect of groping about with his eyes open under
thirty or forty feet of water, clearer than glass, would
have been irresistible.</p>

<p>As it was, he did nothing worse to shock the Governor
than attempt to drink some of the same water during the
<i>al fresco</i> banquet held, while the <i>barcas</i> were moored to the
low papyrus bushes round the fountain or, as I should call
it, the spring, which was the only place on the whole river
where there was room for two or three boats together.</p>

<p>Whether his Excellency considered all water unwholesome,
or that Will&rsquo;s rushing to drink it in place of wine
was a reflection on his hospitality, did not appear. I do not
know when I have seen such a scene, which in a different
way reminded me of the pictures of a certain Watteau
captured by my Lord Eastry in one of his prizes, and now
hanging in Will&rsquo;s gallery; though I do not maintain that
the Governor&rsquo;s ladies, beautiful and appropriate as their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
light summer robes were, approached the Watteau ladies
in elegance of costume. But, on the other hand, the prim
fountain with Diana in the centre, supported by two
dolphins, with their lips curled and their tails plaited,
certainly did not come up to our clear pool, as deep as
many a house is high, carrying on its bosom three or
four great <i>barcas</i>, hanging with crimson and silver, and
ringed all round by overhanging palmetto-like clumps of the
feathery papyrus of old Egypt. Nor, I confess, do the men
in Monsieur Watteau&rsquo;s pictures, who are generally dancing,
come up to men like Captain Troubridge and Captain
Berry, in the uniform of His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy. And every
little detail, each feather in the plumes of the papyrus, each
jewel, every burnished nail within reflecting distance of the
water, was mirrored as clearly as the bright blue uniforms
and shining epaulettes of His Majesty&rsquo;s officers, and the
great masses of crimson in the boat-hangings. We had
music, too, from the Governor&rsquo;s&mdash;well, I call them lute-players&mdash;especially
brought over from Naples, wearing the
old doublet and hose, crimson and silver liveries of the
Governor&rsquo;s family, which their forerunners had worn when
Tommaso de Vigilia painted them three centuries before
in the pictures hanging in the Governor&rsquo;s palace. I could
believe that these were the same liveries, for in Sicily
servants&rsquo; f&ecirc;te-liveries are not made for them, but made for
the household, and handed on from one servant to another,
as a saddle from horse to horse.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long the banquet may have lasted,
there was such profusion of pastrycooks&rsquo; viands and fruits
and wines. The Governor looked as if he expected Will to
die when he took an empty goblet and, dipping it into the
clear water, drank it off two or three times filled; though,
as we had put into his port for the purpose of getting water
for our ships, it did not appear why we should consider it
unfit for drink. Had I been enjoying Will&rsquo;s place beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
Donna Rusidda, and able to converse with her elegantly, as
he was, I think I should have been content for our <i>barca</i> to
have swayed gently on the bubbling waters of the spring&mdash;to
give you some idea of the size of the spring there were
four of these <i>barcas</i> floating on it at one time&mdash;for the rest of
that summer day. But I could see that Will was fidgeting
to be off, and presently he asked the Admiral if he and I
might leap ashore off the high beak of our <i>barca</i>, which was
overhanging some part of the bank. He made the excuse
of some strange flower or the like. The boatman, seeing
our intent, uttered some swift warning in Sicilian, which
the Governor very politely translated to Will to tell the
Admiral; but Master Will only used general terms of its
not being safe, and the Admiral said, &ldquo;My Lord, a jump
like that would not frighten my officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, jumping together, we got more than we bargained
for: we shot through the bank like a couple of bullets.
We were almost up to our middles in thick black slime,
of which you could not have dreamed the possibility so
near that transparent water. Luckily for us, or I verily
believe we might have been swallowed up, the good-natured
boatman had unshipped the oars and held them
out to us, and we were able to pull ourselves up on to the
<i>barca</i>, where we sat on the end to dry our blackened legs in
the sun, and presently the <i>barcas</i> swung round and dropped
down stream.</p>

<p>The sun was now so powerful that long before we were
back at the mouth of the river we were dry enough to have
accepted the invitation of the courteous Sicilians and gone
back among them to sit without fear of soiling them, more
especially since we had removed our shoes and stockings&mdash;there
was much naked-foot work on board ship in those
days&mdash;but Will said that he could not sit beside ladies
in such a plight, and I had never any say but Will&rsquo;s say,
though I did not know what was in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
The town of Syracuse looks as I could imagine the cities
of the Bible would have looked, when one sees it from the
mouth of the Anapo at the opposite side of the great port
on a July noon. Not a film of smoke rises from the low
flat roofs of the mellow white-and-yellow houses, which, in
their turn, seem to be crouching down within the shadow
of the city walls. There is even a temple, for the cathedral
is but the Temple of Minerva, with the columns still protruding
from the northern face.</p>

<p>I should have said that only Will and I went to the
mouth of the river, walking from where the water became
too shallow for the <i>barcas</i>; the rest of the Admiral&rsquo;s party
rumbled off in the coaches to see the ruins of Epipol&aelig; and
Achradina, and the Greek castle of Euryalus and the street
of tombs, the theatre, amphitheatre, and much more that I
cannot remember of ancient Syracuse, though the Admiral
had had Mr. Comyn to tell the younger officers about them
most carefully. Will and I had been dismissed, as not
being in fit condition to ride in gilt coaches with crimson
velvet hangings, and had orders to have the barge at the
landing-stairs under the Marina at such a time. I know
that I was glad to be excused from parading in state round
miles of old stones. The Admiral would not willingly miss
a stone that had any ancient history hanging about it; and
with a guide telling the story first in Sicilian, and the
Governor, who was slow at taking the drift, putting it into
Italian for Mr. Comyn, and Mr. Comyn, who was slow with
his Italian, putting it into English for the Admiral, and the
Admiral, not being satisfied, putting his questions and persisting
with them till he understood his point, it would be
a long day. The roads, too, were such that the coaches
went slower than a walk. Will had more in his mind, but
this I did not know then.</p>

<p>You may be sure that the Admiral had not embarked on
this inland voyage of discovery before he had made certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
that the wind would be lacking to carry the fleet, which
had now everything on board, out. Seeing that the day
was one of those days without enough air to blow a candle
out, he said to Will:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that we have offended his Chameleonship
after all.&rdquo; And somehow I believe that Will&rsquo;s translation
of this to the Governor was a very lame affair.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span>&mdash;Satisfying a
Prince&rsquo;s Honour.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OMING to where the road into the city and the road
to the ruins divided, at a spot where a few almost-buried
columns marked the site of the ancient
market-place&mdash;the Agora is the Greek term, I believe&mdash;the
Prince of Favara and his sister made their excuses and
bade their servants drive home to the Mont&rsquo; alti palace;
and here they waited till sunset, within their palace, in the
best poor state that the Marchese&rsquo;s reduced circumstances
permitted.</p>

<p>Not having received the expected communication&mdash;either
while Will was in his company on the Anapo, nor in the
hours which elapsed in the interval&mdash;at sunset, the Prince,
with two gentlemen of his acquaintance, rowed out in a
private <i>barca</i> to the <i>Vanguard</i>, there to demand to see
Will. Now Will, as it chanced, was the officer on watch,
so they found their man easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will understand why I have come,&rdquo; said the Prince,
adding a great many roundabout and studiedly ceremonious
phrases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Will, with equally studied carelessness,
having noticed something in the Prince&rsquo;s manner.</p>

<p>I was present, and had some inkling that a storm was
brewing; though otherwise I knew nothing of what it was
about, until I had it from Will afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
&ldquo;Last night you did my sister, the Princess of Favara,
the honour of paying her your addresses in the recognised
Sicilian fashion of appealing to the lady herself in the first
instance, to know if your attentions would be acceptable.
I may tell you that the ladies of a house like ours, if our
possessions are diminished, do not make their decision in
so brief a period&mdash;though this is nothing unusual for people
of no family. But though courtships in Sicily are not of
long duration, as far as the lady&rsquo;s decision to accept or
reject the addresses is concerned, the accepted suitor goes
immediately to the father or guardian, states that he has
the lady&rsquo;s consent, gives an account of his position and
property, and, if everything is satisfactory, arrangements
are then made. You have not done this. As you did my
sister the honour of offering her your attentions, and as she
did you the honour of accepting them, I have come here to
know why you have not called upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Will maintained an air of indifference and silence,
the Prince went on to say: &ldquo;I should have mentioned that
there are two circumstances which made my sister accept
the suit of a stranger upon so brief an acquaintance. She
was aware that your ship will sail as soon as the wind
springs up, and it was in defiance of the prophecy that the
last of our house will come to an evil end by reason of
love for a fair-haired stranger from the north. It is the
motto of our family that we fear neither man nor fate,
and it has been our pride to live up to our motto. It
seemed to both my sister and myself that you were the
man indicated by the prophecy, and it was our duty to defy
it. When you came below her window last night, she
consulted me as to whether you were the man indicated,
and as it seemed to us both that you were, she accepted
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my good sir,&rdquo; said Will, speaking very rapidly in
his excellent Italian, &ldquo;I am already engaged to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
lady in England. I only understood that serenading was
the custom of the country. I was not in the least aware
that it constituted an offer of marriage, which I was not in
a position to make. However, though I cannot marry your
sister, I am perfectly willing to offer you the satisfaction
which a gentleman expects; and at four bells&mdash;that is, at
eight o&rsquo;clock&mdash;till when it is my watch, I shall be at your
service. I must trust to you to find a place where we shall
not be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Latomia dei Cappucini beside the ancient wheel-well
will do excellently, and a carriage shall be waiting
at the landing-stage to convey yourself and your seconds
at eight o&rsquo;clock. Will you give me the names of two of
your brother officers who may confer with my seconds
after you have decided your choice of weapons. It is your
choice. I am the challenger, although you anticipated me
in expressing your readiness to give me satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sword is the only weapon for gentlemen,&rdquo; says
Will, as fine as you please; though he was but eighteen
years old and young in the art of fence, while his adversary,
being a Sicilian gentleman and nearer thirty, was like to
be an expert swordsman. And then, though they had
been so mighty civil to each other as to who was the
challenger, I heard the Prince whisper to Will as I went
down to the ward-room to see who would act for Will&mdash;for,
mind you, there was not one of them that liked him&mdash;I
heard him whisper, &ldquo;<i>A l&rsquo;outrance</i>,&rdquo; and Will replied, with
the most contemptuous indifference, &ldquo;If you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Will, being the officer on duty, had no time to
waste in talking on what I have just writ down, though he
must perforce attend to the Sicilian Prince who was come
on board about a matter so serious. All he said to me
was&mdash;&ldquo;Tell them I am going to fight this Italian at eight
o&rsquo;clock, and ask if any of them will act for me. There is
not one of them upon whom I have any personal claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
It was with some trepidation that I knocked at the door
of the ward-room. I knew that most of them were not on
terms with him, and had a sinking feeling at my heart that
I should have to go back and confess that he had not a friend
to serve him in this pinch, in which case the matter would
have to remain until the Captain came on board and told
off two officers to do it. But when I went in and told my
errand, every officer in the room got up and laid his sword
on the table. So it fell, of course, to the two seniors
present, one of whom was the First Lieutenant, Mr.
Galwey; and they spoke in the highest terms of Will; and
all present then went on deck.</p>

<p>When the two chosen to act as Will&rsquo;s seconds went
forward to meet the Prince&rsquo;s seconds, a most curious thing
happened, for, the chaplain being ashore with the Admiral,
there was not a man on board save Will who could speak
their lingo. So here we had the strange spectacle of the
principal in a duel acting as the interpreter between his
own and his adversary&rsquo;s seconds.</p>

<p>And, the matter being settled in this fashion, the Prince
and his seconds went presently ashore. As soon as he
was off watch, Will and his seconds followed, and Will
wrote in the boat a line to his mother in the very probable
event of his death, though I had no fear but that he would
give a good account of himself. Will&rsquo;s seconds had asked
that I should be allowed to accompany him as being his
nearest friend; and it was granted willingly.</p>

<p>We did not go through the town when we landed, but
skirted along the sea front to where the road from the
drawbridge conducts to the ruins of ancient Syracuse; and
no sooner were we on the mainland, than we turned up
to the right and drove for about a mile till we came to the
Capuchin nunnery which stands on the brink of one of the
most remarkable monuments in the world, the vast Latomia
or quarry in which the unfortunate Athenians, captured at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
the siege of Syracuse, were confined. The singularity of
the Latomia is that the quarries cut into enormous natural
caverns, which had existed, probably unknown, beneath a
thin shell of stone and earth. They went on quarrying
until all the roof of the cavern had been cut away and its
sides were as perpendicular as cliffs down to a few feet
from the bottom, where fresh caverns, and shallower in
depth, begin and stretch away into the bowels of the earth.
This Latomia, so vividly described by Thucydides, as Mr.
Comyn afterwards told us, seemed about a mile in length,
varying in breadth from a few yards to a hundred yards,
and was, in depth, of perhaps a hundred feet. It was
largely covered with undergrowth, though there were some
fine orange and lemon groves, valued, I was told, because,
being somewhat sheltered from the sun, they came on
when other crops were over. In the centre of one of
these lemon groves, near the antique well, was an open
glade and a lawn, used I do not know for what purpose.
And here the duel was to take place.</p>

<p>No sooner had the fight begun than my worst fears were
realised, for I saw by the Prince&rsquo;s pose and the first few
passes, that he was a practised swordsman. But he was
fighting with a demon rather than with a man. I never
saw a human being with such a fighting fury as Will, who
sprang at him like a leopard. I do not see, however,
how this should have prevailed, with Will&rsquo;s ignorance of
fence, had not the mossy ground on which the Prince was
standing proved rotten, as mossy ground will at times, the
surface rubbing off and leaving a slippery mud. The
Prince&rsquo;s foot slipped, and Will struck his sword out of his
hand. The Prince called out to him to despatch him; but
Will said, with his air, &ldquo;My honour is satisfied&mdash;I am not
one to kill a fallen man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince protested that he should send fresh seconds
the next morning, when the seconds on both sides decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
that the duel could not proceed. And so the matter
was left.</p>

<p>You can imagine what shakings of the hand we gave
Will as we took him back to the landing-place for having
defended in such a way the honour of the ship; and I
believe that our two lieutenants were settled in their own
minds that there should be no second duel, considering the
handsome way in which Will had given the Prince his life,
though, with one of Will&rsquo;s temper, it was not easy to see
how the duel was to be prevented, if the Prince sent fresh
seconds, save by the authority of the Captain, who could
confine him to the ship, or the Admiral.</p>

<p>Considering that Will was one of the Admiral&rsquo;s staff, the
First Lieutenant, his senior second, concluded to lay the
whole matter before the Admiral when he came on board.
And he came on board very soon afterwards in the highest
of spirits, for he always loved a good day ashore as well as
any A.B. in his fleet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; cried the Admiral, when he had
heard the First Lieutenant&rsquo;s story, which, of course, was
told in whispers that I did not overhear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see
the young man&mdash;His Highness, I suppose I ought to call
him&mdash;myself. I can&rsquo;t afford to delay the fleet if a breeze
springs up to let us get at the French, and I hope that none
of my officers will ever shirk a situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The barge was still at the gangway, the Lieutenant had
hailed them to await orders, and the Admiral prepared to
descend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you supped, sir?&rdquo; asked the Lieutenant; and
the Admiral without pausing replied, &ldquo;I shall have a better
appetite if I wait till this matter is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he landed a few minutes afterwards, he hired a
coach&mdash;there are always two or three hackneys at the
landing-place with such a large fleet in port&mdash;and bade
the man drive to the Prince of Favara&rsquo;s. The Prince was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
well known in Syracuse, though he had no palace of his
own there, but was visiting with his uncle; and the man
drove the Admiral without delay to the Palazzo Mont&rsquo; alti.</p>

<p>The Admiral, who had taken the chaplain with him as
interpreter, in the enforced absence of Will, asked if the
Prince were in; and the porter replied in the affirmative,
not knowing that the Prince, who had entered the palace
with his seconds immediately after the duel, had left by the
garden door and gone to sup in a favourite tavern near the
Marina. Three or four servants passed the English officers
from the great gate across the courtyard, up the staircase
which wound round it, terminating in an arcade, and
through a succession of fine chambers into the principal
salon, which had a large mirror at each end with a kind of
sofa arranged under it, facing about a dozen chairs arranged
in a horseshoe. Along the sides of the room were more
couches interrupted by mirrors with wide marble shelves
in front of them, supported by gilded lions&rsquo; legs. Lustres
hung on each side of the mirrors, and they supported tall
Chinese vases on French stands of gilded bronze. The
floor was tiled and covered with patterns, a good many
tiles going to form each pattern, and there was a small
carpet at each end of the room where the chairs were
arranged. The Admiral commented on all these to his
chaplain, for there was a goodish delay. In fact, they
were so busy taking in the details in order to pass the
time, that it was only when they heard the light tapping of
a woman&rsquo;s heels on the tiles close beside them, that they
perceived that some one had entered the room.</p>

<p>The Admiral, as his wont was even over trifles, had
been full of animation when he was speaking, which
changed to an air of grave respectfulness when he perceived
that it was Donna Rusidda herself who had entered. She
was alone, out of compliment to the Admiral, or because
she did not wish the ancient lady, whom she maintained as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
a kind of duenna, to hear what passed between them. The
Admiral had brought me with him, saying, &ldquo;You keep the
conscience of our young scapegrace, Trinder: you had best
come along and answer for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donna Rusidda naturally did not know the whole of the
affair, though she had had it from her maid already that
a duel had been fought on her account, which had been
terminated by the disarmament of her brother, who had
announced his intention of finding fresh seconds to renew
it on the following day, as his late seconds would not
consent to its being proceeded with. It was, indeed, for
this purpose that he had gone to the albergo by the Marina,
where, that being a resort of the young bloods, he was
likely to meet with friends to accommodate him.</p>

<p>I thought I had never seen any one look more lovely than
this girl, whose clear dusky cheeks were flushed till the
blood showed rosily through them with the treble excitement.
For she had come alone into the presence of
strangers, and the strangers were so famous, and come
upon a mission which concerned her so closely. And
though the Admiral had not then won the victory with
which he was shortly to astonish the world, the connection
between the noble families of the Two Sicilies and Spain
was very strong, their kings being of the same family; and
his achievements of taking the two Spanish three-deckers
one after the other, with a handful of boarders from his
seventy-four, was fresh in their memories. It was this
little one-armed man, with the sensitive mouth, who had
led the boarders in that heroic fight at St. Vincent.</p>

<p>She was glad she had come in without his noticing her
and seen his animation as he was discussing the unfamiliar
aspects of the Mont&rsquo; alti salon with his chaplain. She had
seen his natural energy instead of the quiet air of dignity
and respect which he put on for her. She had come, she
explained, to tell them that her brother was out; she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
despatched a messenger for him, and begged that they
would remain and give her the honour of receiving them
until her brother arrived. &ldquo;Meanwhile, might she offer
them some slight refreshment?&rdquo; Servants were entering
with fruit and wine and cakes. The Admiral begged her
to excuse them. He had come like the Roman Senator
of old, who went to Carthage with peace and war in his
robe, and he would not break bread in the house of the
Mont&rsquo; alti until he knew whether he should leave them as a
friend or an enemy. In fact, now that one of the squadron
that he was engaging, to use his metaphor, was in range,
he was nothing but a commander. The Admiral, as is
well known, was never held to be indifferent to the charm
of women; and the slender girl, with her dark beauty
thrown up by the white and pearls of her evening attire, was
remarkable even among Italian women in their heyday
for her exquisite grace. She had, too, the kind of face
which might be called, with equal truth, haunting and
haunted,&mdash;it haunts my memory still,&mdash;and she had in her
eyes, or perhaps it was in her expression, the look of one
born to be the victim of a great misfortune.</p>

<p>The Admiral received her with dignity as well as
profound respect, and as the interview proceeded without
either side caring to commit itself until the Prince of
Favara arrived, this dignity settled into an air of dignified
resolution. He looked as I have seen him look when he
was going into action, before he had quite settled some
detail in the attack. When all was plain fighting, he
smiled. As the small, slender figure, braced with the air
of a commander&rsquo;s expectancy, stood before her, she had
some opportunity of knowing what manner of man this
Nelson was, when he was about to hurl a fleet of England
on a fleet of France.</p>

<p>I can see it all before me, as distinctly as on the night
of that 21st of July, &rsquo;98: the world&rsquo;s great Admiral, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
was to be, in his attitude of &ldquo;prepare for action,&rdquo; and
the enemy represented by that gentle, half-terrified, half-mystified
Southern beauty, with the background of the
high, vaulted, half-furnished chamber in the medi&aelig;val
Sicilian palace. It was now quite dusk, and the candles
in the sconces on each side of the mirrors gave only a half
light. There were no candles in the vast crystal chandelier
which hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Presently we heard footsteps through the suite of
reception-rooms leading to the salon, and the Prince of
Favara entered with his uncle the Marchese, and two other
Sicilian gentlemen. The Marchese had, it appeared, gone
out with him to assist him in finding seconds. They did
not seem so astonished as might have been expected at
the presence of Donna Rusidda, for they had spoken with
her duenna in the chamber leading immediately into ours.
But they had the look of men who had come in full of
some excitement, suddenly checked by an important piece
of news, and greeted the Admiral with marked civility.</p>

<p>It was clearly for him to speak, and he began with his
usual courage and directness. &ldquo;I have come, your Highness,
to express my regret that an officer of my fleet
should have been guilty of a practical jest upon a lady;
but I understand that he has already given you the
satisfaction of a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency is mistaken,&rdquo; said the Prince: &ldquo;I am
not satisfied. I have just arranged with these gentlemen,
the Conte di Noto and the Conte di Spaccaforno, to seek
his seconds and arrange for the completion of the duel
<i>&agrave; l&rsquo;outrance</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that he has given you your life, your
Highness, which is sufficient satisfaction for any gentleman
that I have met in a profession which exists for the purpose
of fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be sufficient by the English code, your Excellency,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
said the Prince firmly, but quite courteously; &ldquo;but according
to the code of our country such an insult can only be
wiped out by the death of one of the combatants. I shall
insist on the meeting being resumed, or brand Signor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardres,&rdquo; said the Admiral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;as a coward who insulted a lady and then ran
away in the great fleet of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me a strange kind of cowardice for a boy of
eighteen, just studying the art of fence, to meet a man of
thirty, and an accomplished swordsman, and when he has&mdash;partly
by accident, I will allow&mdash;disarmed his adversary,
to suffer him to depart untouched, especially when he knows
that that adversary had it in his heart to kill him without
mercy, and indeed protested that a new duel must be fought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Prince only replied, &ldquo;I shall brand him as a
coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, your Highness,&rdquo; said the Admiral, with a
wicked look upon his face, such as I think I never saw
again in all the years that I had the honour of serving
under him, &ldquo;that you will need all the courage you have
to-morrow morning, when the duello is resumed. You
will take it up exactly where it ceased. You were lying
on your back, I believe, with your sword a dozen yards
away in a garlic bed or something of the kind, and
Lieutenant Hardres was standing over you, sword in
hand. No interference will be tolerated by the guard,
which I shall land to see fair play, and the guns of the
ships will be trained on Syracuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince&rsquo;s face did blench as the chaplain translated
the words delivered by the Admiral in a voice that was
like a volley of grape shot; and after a few minutes&rsquo;
conference with the Marchese, he replied courteously, but
with a quiet ring of sarcasm:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will allow me, your Excellency, I will go with
you when you return to your ship, and have my throat cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
by Signor Hardres at once. The solution you pronounce
is, I see, the correct one. Unfortunately I had no precedent
to go upon. A Sicilian, in Signor Hardres&rsquo;s place, would
have killed me, as I would have killed him. I am at your
service whenever you are ready to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral&rsquo;s face cleared of wrath like the sky after a
thunderstorm: he was ever the most generous of men, but
he had a look of mystification when Donna Rusidda, who
had been present all the while, but had taken no part in
the proceedings till this moment, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Marchese, you have lived many years, and are
referred to by every one on matters of manners and
breeding.&rdquo; He bowed. &ldquo;What happens when a lady,
having begun by accepting the suit of a cavalier, sees
something to make her change her mind and desire to be
relieved of the suit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a thing was never done in my time, Donna niece,
by a lady of a family like ours, but tradition is clear upon
the point: the quarrel then belongs to the rejected suitor,
who would have the right to ask a gentleman&rsquo;s satisfaction
from the kinsman to whom it fell to represent her. But
he would also have the right to be indifferent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, then, I say, and I swear by my patron, Santa Rosalia,
that it is true, that I am no longer willing to receive the
suit of Signor Hardres, the quarrel is, as you say, his, and
it will be for him to demand the fresh duello, not for the
Prince, my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said the Marchese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Signor Admiral,&rdquo; said the girl, with a most
beautiful expression on her face&mdash;which I, not knowing
the Sicilians so well as I did afterwards, imagined to
express a woman&rsquo;s holy joy in peace-making&mdash;&ldquo;will you
have it conveyed to Signor Hardres that I wish to withdraw
my acceptance of his suit, and that the quarrel is
now his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can answer for it that your brother will hear no
more from him, madam,&rdquo; replied the Admiral, stooping
very low to kiss her hand&mdash;for he, too, used the same
interpretation as I. &ldquo;And then, your Excellency,&rdquo; he
said, bowing to the Marchese, &ldquo;and your Highness,&rdquo;
bowing to the Prince, &ldquo;as I have full power to represent
Lieutenant Hardres, we may regard this incident as at
an end. And now, madam,&rdquo; he added, looking at Donna
Rusidda straight in the face with his most gracious smile,
&ldquo;I shall, if you invite me again, partake of this excellent
entertainment, for I have not yet supped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invitation was, of course, graciously repeated; and
I was glad to see that the Prince had some of his sister&rsquo;s
graciousness, for he took one of the trays&mdash;the servants
had been sent from the room&mdash;and brought it, saying,
&ldquo;Hungry work, your Excellency!&rdquo; And the smile with
which he said this, and the smile with which the Admiral
received it, laid the foundation of the friendship which,
until its tragical termination, played so conspicuous a part
in the Admiral&rsquo;s life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span>&mdash;Of the Battle
of the Nile, on the First of
August, 1798.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW days later, when a breeze, blowing right out
of the Great Port, sprang up, as was its wont, in
the afternoon, the fleet made all haste to stand
out and away after the French, not before the Admiral had
read Master Will a sharp lecture for his folly in getting
into such a scrape, and suspended him from personal
attendance for two weeks&mdash;a sentence which was never
finished, for in the meantime events happened of such a
magnitude that all everyday matters, except such as had
regard to the ships being in their best fighting and sailing
trim, were forgotten as completely as if they had been
swallowed in the Deluge.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Will was half sorry at the prospect
of having to spend the two weeks with his fellow-officers
in the ward-room. In the case of friendship between a
man of forty and a boy of eighteen, it is almost inevitable
that the man must like the boy far more strongly than
the boy likes him, and that the man should crave for the
boy&rsquo;s society while the boy accepts or tolerates the man&rsquo;s.
In the long chase after the French, from the time he left
Syracuse on July 25th to the time that he sighted their
tops in the afternoon of that memorable August 1st, there
were tedious hours, when he felt an intense craving for
the boy whom he had adopted more completely than his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
own stepson, Josiah Nisbet, who was also a lieutenant on
the ship.</p>

<p>But for Will these were pleasant hours. He had up to
that minute not only seen but little of his fellow-officers&mdash;he
had hardly even been on speaking terms with them
outside of professional duties. But they could not help
feeling that he had done the ship and the service credit
by the way in which he had maintained his quarrel against
the Prince. And while they regarded the offence of
serenading in jest as a very venial one, they regarded
his fortnight&rsquo;s suspension as a purely formal punishment.
Will might have been quite a hero if his pride had allowed
him to be &ldquo;hail fellow, well met.&rdquo; But it was as impossible
for him to change it as it is for a leopard to
change his spots or his skin (I forget how the phrase runs),
and so he enjoyed a modified kind of popularity, and a
much heightened respect from the ward-room at large,
while some of the older men, like the First Lieutenant,
Mr. Galwey, who had acted for him, made a friend of one
who clearly had exceptional qualities. It produced a most
unexpected and notable passage in my life; for the Admiral,
having accustomed himself to the keeping of Will at his
elbow, ready to perform whatever little duty might present
itself, was lost without him, and being accustomed to the
sight of me, whom he had often admitted as company for
Will, used me as a kind of supernumerary until Will&rsquo;s
offence should have been condoned.</p>

<p>I must not be taken to imply that he extended to me the
strong personal interest which he felt in Will. I had the
duties, not the confidence. But nevertheless I saw much
of him during that very critical week of his life, and it was
at this time that the change came over him&mdash;the black
shadow of doubt which had kept him irritable and depressed
giving way to one of his irresistible convictions.</p>

<p>Not that he had ever been in doubt as to his principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
of action, for he had never had but one principle, and that
was to have his cannon within pistol-shot of the French.
But he was fearful of not getting there in time; for the
French, in his opinion, had two objective points to strike
at&mdash;the Neapolitan kingdom, which was defenceless without
his fleet, and India which was also defenceless if the army
in the French fleet should arrive in Egypt with ships of
Tippoo Saib waiting at Suez to embark them for India, and
no British ships at the mouth of the Nile to prevent their
disembarking. I think the greatest ambition in all his life
was to destroy Buonaparte and his army of 40,000 men,
whom he knew to be in the convoy guarded by the French
fleet. We had thirteen ships of the line, but none above
seventy-fours&mdash;one fifty-gun ship and one brig. Had we
had frigates we should have found the French long ere that;
for frigates, as even landsmen know, are the eyes of a fleet,
and had we possessed frigates they would have been of the
highest service in capturing the transports of the convoy.
But had we met them I am convinced that the absence of
frigates would not have prevented the most terrible calamity
which ever befel the French army. The convoy we knew
to be immense, to convey such an army and its supplies
for a distant expedition; and we knew it to be guarded by
a fleet far superior, on paper, to ourselves. I say advisedly
on paper, because the presence of our Admiral was of itself
sufficient to neutralise the disparity, and because of the
disadvantage at which any fleet fights which has not only to
defeat an enemy, but also to save its helpless transports.</p>

<p>As far as we could judge from various sources of information,
their fleet consisted of sixteen of the line, one of
them the tremendous <i>L&rsquo;Orient</i> of 120 guns, and three or four
others of eighty, but three of them Venetian and not French,
and therefore not likely to be so well served. Besides
which they had frigates and a cloud of small armed vessels,
gunboats and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
But their superiority of force hardly entered into the
Admiral&rsquo;s calculations. His orders were the same for whatever
force, and had we fallen in with the French the scene
must have been appalling; for recognising the impossibility
of rapidly taking possession of so many prizes, especially as
they were crowded with armed men and we were without
frigates, his orders were to destroy and not to capture.</p>

<p>He may, too, have been urged to this by the belief that
the army was commanded by Buonaparte, whom he considered
to be the arch-fiend, as he considered all French
to be the enemies of the human race.</p>

<p>For the purpose of attacking the convoy, he divided our
own fleet into three squadrons: the <i>Vanguard</i>, the <i>Minotaur</i>,
the 50-gun ship <i>Leander</i>, the <i>Audacious</i>, the <i>Defence</i>, and
the <i>Zealous</i> under himself; the <i>Orion</i>, <i>Goliath</i>, <i>Majestic</i>, and
<i>Bellerophon</i> under Captain Saumarez; and the <i>Culloden</i>,
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Swiftsure</i>, and <i>Theseus</i> under Captain Troubridge.
Two of these squadrons were to engage the ships of war,
no matter what their force, while the third was to dash
among the transports and sink and destroy as many as it
could. The scene, even to a man-of-war&rsquo;s-man, is awful to
picture. Transport after transport settling down by the head
or stern, the water covered with their boats and black with
struggling men; Buonaparte, if he were not already on the
largest warship, fleeing to it; half the British war-ships
engaging every French fighting-ship till they sank themselves
or had sunk, taken or driven their antagonists to
desert the convoy, and the others running in among the
transports and thrashing them down like apples off a tree.</p>

<p>But it was not to be so: the Admiral&rsquo;s prophecy was
literally fulfilled as far as that convoy, the most momentous
which ever left the shores of France, was concerned&mdash;&ldquo;no
frigates; to which has been and may again be
attributed the loss of the French fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may imagine how it weighed upon such a mind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
to have the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of my Lord St. Vincent&rsquo;s fleet under his
command for some weeks, and with the enemy about to
strike some vital blow&mdash;and yet no sign of him! He wrote
to Troubridge&mdash;&ldquo;Do not fret at anything: I wish I never
had; but my return to Syracuse in 1798 broke my heart,
which on any extraordinary anxiety now shows itself&mdash;be
that feeling pain or pleasure&rdquo;; and again, &ldquo;On the 18th
I had near died with the swellings of some of the vessels
of the heart. More people, perhaps, die of broken hearts
than we are aware of.&rdquo; And he wrote to his chief, Lord
St. Vincent: &ldquo;Every moment I have to regret the frigates
having left me. Your lordship deprived yourself of frigates
to make mine certainly the first squadron in the world, and
I feel that I have zeal and activity to do credit to your
appointment, and yet to be unsuccessful hurts me most
sensibly. But if they are above water I will find them out,
and if possible bring them to battle. You have done your
part in giving me so fine a fleet, and I hope to do mine
in making use of them.&rdquo; And added to this he had the
mortification of seeing the Neapolitan Government, whose
forces were hardly worthy a place in the line of battle,
refusing supplies which was the one service they could
perform for the allies without whose fleet they felt like
children left in the dark to wolves. The loss of frigates
by the pusillanimity of the commander, who returned to
Gibraltar because he thought that Nelson must give up,
being baffled as to the whereabouts of the French fleet,
the ingratitude of the Neapolitans, the malignity of Admirals
Parker and Orde, who had been passed over because the
safety of Europe depended on the fleet&rsquo;s winning a decisive
victory, weighed heavily on the Admiral&rsquo;s spirits, and
brought on that irritability and sickness which so frequently
followed inaction and disappointment in this extraordinary
fighter. But for some reason, the fair wind which carried
us out of the great harbour of Syracuse blew away these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
vapours from his brain. He augured that we were on the
scent, and the confidence and cheerfulness borne of good
omens returned to him. We had a fine stiff sailing breeze,
and he crowded on every stitch of canvas we could use,
although the flagship, which had never been properly
repaired since the gale which had dismasted her off
Toulon, was hardly in a condition to bear it. We stood
straight for Cerigo, which is the island that lies at the foot
of the Morea, as some island lies broken off at the foot of
every peninsula. As we neared the Gulf of Koron, having
no frigates, the <i>Culloden</i> was detailed to enter it for intelligence;
and on her return the next day she brought with
her a French brig, and information that the enemy&rsquo;s fleet
had been seen steering south-east from Kandia about
fourteen days before. And on the same day Captain Ball
of the <i>Alexander</i> obtained the like intelligence from a vessel
passing close to the fleet. The Admiral immediately bore
up under all sail for Alexandria. We left Syracuse on
July 25th, and made such an extraordinary passage that
on the evening of the 31st the Admiral made the signal
for the fleet to close, we being so near Alexandria. Early
on the morning of the 1st, we having no frigates, the
<i>Alexander</i> and the <i>Swiftsure</i> were sent ahead to look out;
and &ldquo;at ten a.m. the <i>Alexander</i> made a signal supposed for
the land, all the fleet in company.&rdquo; At four o&rsquo;clock the
Pharos Tower was visible in that clear atmosphere, from
where I was standing by the Admiral on the poop, though
it was at the distance of four or five leagues to the south-south-west.
The Admiral was by this time extraordinarily
anxious in scanning every ship in the fleet, and the whole
horizon with the eye of an eagle.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw what I can only describe as a holy
joy beam over his face. The <i>Zealous</i> was signalling, and
almost before the signalling began he cried out, &ldquo;My God!
it&rsquo;s the French.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
Sure enough it was the French. And as the signal blew
out stiff on the north-west wind&mdash;&ldquo;the French fleet,
sixteen sail of the line&rdquo;&mdash;a thrill of joy went through every
soul in the ship, and, I can swear, in all the other ships.
Men laughed and cried; their hearts were too full for them
to cheer. There was but one thought in every breast, that
the Lord had delivered the French into the hands of
Gideon&mdash;Gideon, the little man with only one arm and one
eye, and half a constitution, over whom I, the midshipman,
standing by his side to take orders, towered.</p>

<p>His first order was a most characteristic one: &ldquo;Send for
Mr. Hardres&mdash;this is a moment at which no fighting man
should be in disgrace.&rdquo; His next was to order dinner to
be prepared. That we should fight, every one in the fleet
took for granted. It was not the Admiral&rsquo;s habit to leave
the enemy time to prepare. To force them to risk he
would take any risk himself. In those latitudes, where
there is no twilight, day drops dead into night, even on an
August day, before seven of the clock. It would be as
much as we could do to lay alongside of them before
nightfall. We should have to fight them in absolute
darkness. But the Admiral reckoned every difficulty in his
favour. He had some opinion of French gunnery, but none
of their courage as seamen; while of his own captains he
had the highest opinion, and placed the firmest reliance on
them for valour and conduct. It had been his practice
during the whole of the cruise, whenever the weather and
circumstances would permit, to have his captains on board
the <i>Vanguard</i>, where he would fully develop to them his
own ideas as to the different and best modes of attack, and
such plans as he proposed to execute upon falling in with
the enemy, whatever their position or situation might be,
by day or by night. There was no possible position which
could be found that he did not take into his calculation, and
for the most advantageous attack of which he had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
digested or arranged the best possible disposition of the
force which he commanded. With the masterly ideas of
the Admiral, therefore, on the subject of naval tactics every
one of the captains was most thoroughly acquainted; and
upon surveying the situation of the enemy they could
ascertain with precision what were his ideas and intentions
without the aid of any further instructions, by which means
signals became almost unnecessary, much time was saved,
and the attention of every captain could almost undistractedly
be paid to the conduct of his particular ship&mdash;a
circumstance from which upon this occasion the advantages
to the general service were almost incalculable.</p>

<p>We found the enemy laying at anchor in line of battle in
a bay upon the larboard, which we afterwards knew to be
Aboukir Bay. Having given his orders about Will and
the dinner with apparent unconcern, of which I doubt
not, now, he had judged the moral effect, he turned to the
Captain&mdash;&ldquo;Haul on the wind, Berry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A top-gallant breeze was blowing, and the Captain gave
orders to take in the royals as we hauled upon the wind.
The whole squadron followed suit except the <i>Alexander</i>
and <i>Swiftsure</i>, which were some miles to the eastward,
scouting; and the <i>Culloden</i>, which was some miles to the
westward, towing a prize of which the whole fleet had
been talking till it saw the tall masts of the French&mdash;a
vessel loaded with wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signal the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Swiftsure</i>,&rdquo; said the Admiral;
his quick eye had seen that Troubridge had already divined
and cast off the wine brig. &ldquo;Signal, &lsquo;Prepare for battle&mdash;attack
the van and centre.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every captain knew that the Admiral&rsquo;s idea was to crush
the enemy&rsquo;s van and centre as they lay at anchor, according
to the oft-discussed plan, and then make the best use he
could of the victory. Each ship got a bower cable out abaft
and bent it forward. We stood in close line of battle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
every ship sounding all the time carefully. There was not
a chart of the Bay in the whole fleet, except a rude sketch
taken by Captain Hallowell in a prize. The French were
lying under the shelter of the cape, and with the head of
their van up to the island, which had a battery of guns and
mortars, and they were flanked by numerous gunboats and
four frigates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stiff work, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, eyeing the formidable
array with its communications to the land secured at either
end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might be worse, Berry,&rdquo; replied the Admiral, looking
at them with the eye of a seaman determined on attack.
And as ideas began to chase through his eager and penetrating
mind, he jerked out, &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t get away anyhow,
they&rsquo;re anchored,&mdash;and where there&rsquo;s room for an enemy&rsquo;s
ship to swing there is room for one of ours to anchor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to force the passage, sir, and take them
on the inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course: they&rsquo;re so strongly secured on the outside
that the guns won&rsquo;t be manned on the inside. If I know
the French they won&rsquo;t even be cleared for action, for they
didn&rsquo;t expect us, Berry. You can wager that they felt sure
of having till to-morrow, even after they saw us coming in.
Who leads, Berry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Goliath</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foley won&rsquo;t want any telling. It was this plan which
took his imagination so that night, in case we had an enemy
supported by the shore. See, there he goes, brave fellow!&rdquo;
he shouted, as Foley, coming up to the leading French
vessel, the <i>Guerrier</i>, and receiving her fire at considerable
disadvantage while half her men were aloft preparing to
furl sail, swung round her, and to the vast astonishment of
her company tried to bring up on her inner side. In this
he failed, in spite of all his precautions: the anchor hung,
and he found himself on the inner quarter of the <i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
the second ship. The <i>Zealous</i>, which was close behind him,
anchored abreast of the <i>Guerrier</i>; and the <i>Orion</i>, <i>Theseus</i>,
and <i>Audacious</i>, the next three ships, followed them inside;
the <i>Audacious</i> bringing up on the bow of the <i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i>;
the <i>Theseus</i> abreast of the <i>Spartiate</i>, but dividing her fire
between the hapless <i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i> and the <i>Aquilon</i>; and the
<i>Orion</i> dividing hers between the <i>Peuple Souverain</i> and the
<i>Franklin</i>.</p>

<p>While they were taking up their positions, and had the
best part of their ships&rsquo; companies engaged in navigating
the ships, they should have been very severely handled
by the French. But the Admiral&rsquo;s instinct was, as ever,
correct: the larboard guns which trained on the land were
neither manned nor ready. The French, of course, did all
they could in the time to reply to the English fire; but
their hurried attempts were unavailing, and in three
minutes&rsquo; time every mast of the <i>Guerrier</i> and <i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i>
was overboard, though they were bare sticks without a sail
set. We were the sixth ship&mdash;you must bear in mind
that our fleet at this moment only consisted of ten ships,
because the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Swiftsure</i> were away to leeward,
and the <i>Culloden</i> away to windward, and the <i>Leander</i>, which
was but a fifty-gun ship, was a long way behind. I
suppose the Admiral had chosen this place, sixth in the
line, because it was doubtful whether the vessel in this
place should follow the other five or lead on the outside.
You can imagine that we, who had never seen a shot fired
from the ship, were in a fine state of excitement. I suppose
I must have winced as a round shot went through the
mizzen-stay close to where I was in attendance on the
Admiral, for he patted me on the shoulder and said to me,
&ldquo;How do you like that music?&rdquo; he having on his own
face his fighting smile of serene superiority. Indeed, he
had not long since come up from his dinner, which was
being served when we came into range of the French guns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
We did not reply for some time: we had to pay so much
attention to navigating; and I own that, though I became
as indifferent to fire as becomes an English sailor, I was a
little startled at finding the shot whizzing over us steadily
when I followed the Admiral up on deck. He had been
good-naturedly allowing me to eat at his table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, youngster,&rdquo; he said, as he patted me.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know that Charles XII. ran away from the first shot
he heard, though afterwards called the Great because of his
bravery. I therefore hope much of you in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This put me on my mettle, especially as Will was there
with his proud fair face flushed with the fighting fever, and
helping to carry a man, who was pouring out blood, to the
companion; for, mind you, it is one thing to have round
shot coming close enough to hear them whistle, and another
thing to see a man, who has been your shipmate for
months, bleeding to death in your arms in the first quarter
of an hour of your first battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall I lay the ship, sir?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alongside of the first ship that has any fight in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no one engaged with number three, sir, though
she is getting a few shot from the <i>Goliath</i> and the <i>Theseus</i>.
She&rsquo;s in line with them, sir: I&rsquo;m afraid some of our shot
may hit them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you lay her at the right distance, Berry. Half a
pistol shot is a very good distance for fighting; you can be
sure of your shot not going wild then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would it do, sir, if we reduced our sail to working
order and passed under her stern, and laid ourselves on the
inside of the next? We shall be a bit awkwardly placed
if we lay ourselves alongside of the third of their line,
because we shall be raked by the fourth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Berry; it would never do for the Admiral to be
afraid of a broadside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was very fine and completely in the spirit of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
Admiral; but I can tell you that we had to pay for it, for
while we had been coming up the <i>Aquilon</i> was double shotting
her guns for us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shorten sail,&rdquo; was the order, and &ldquo;Back the main topsail.&rdquo;
As we laid ourselves alongside of the third ship&mdash;that
was the <i>Spartiate</i>, the fourth&mdash;that was the <i>Aquilon</i>,
raked us with double-shotted guns. The concussion was
awful; the crashing of masts and yards, and the yells and
death groans which arose from our bows, attested the precision
of their aim. The men in the forecastle would have
been fairly staggered if it had not been for Will. I could
see St. Vincent&rsquo;s men looking as if they had received their
death-warrant; and I am sure I felt quite sick, as I was
covered with human blood spouting from the quivering
limbs and mangled bodies all round. But Will, who was
scarce nineteen, with colour unchanged and eyes flashing
brighter, exposed himself in the most reckless and daring
manner, and this in spite not only of the cannonade but of
a tremendous fire of musketry. Time after time our forward
guns were cleared for a minute and re-manned.</p>

<p>There was the usual serio-comedy which creeps into the
most awful moments of our lives; for there in the midst of
it all was a marine lying, apparently dead, on the deck.
Not being able to see how he came by his death, Will turned
him over to examine, and found that he was not only alive
but uninjured. Drawing his sword Will obliged the man to
rise under pain of immediate death; and, you would not
believe it, the poor wretch had scarcely stood upright, when
a bar that connects grape shot passed through both thigh-bones
and could not be extricated. After two days of
torture death relieved his sufferings. While Will himself
stood upright and uninjured, and while he was attending to
this one, the marine who stood on his other side, waiting to
take his order, had his head carried off by a thirty-two
pounder, while a large splinter from the foremast stripped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
the right thigh-bone of the midshipman who was with him
from the knee-pan to the hip. He lived to the next day, and
then sank under his sufferings.</p>

<p>By this we were nearly unmanageable, and cracking
masts and yards in close contact with the <i>Spartiate</i>.</p>

<p>Presently the Admiral came along, cool as an orange; and
though I was getting a little accustomed now to the awful
scene that was going on round me, I was not particularly
sorry when he called to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Youngster, get the number of wounded from the
surgeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when I entered the cockpit, stumbling over the
wounded, and came to the surgeon&rsquo;s assistants, I own I was
unnerved a little, for I found them busily employed taking
our old Quartermaster&rsquo;s right arm out of the socket, whose
only son, well known to me, I had just seen broken to
pieces by a round shot which dashed him into the gun he
was serving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my boy doing well, sir?&rdquo; he gasped in a low agonised
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I answered reverently, and I felt fit to
choke, and the old man groaned heavily. He suspected the
truth from the tone of my voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pour a glass of Madeira down his throat,&rdquo; said the
surgeon: &ldquo;he is sinking fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The complication of noises in this den of misery, from
the shrill cry from agonised youth to the deep and hollow
groan of death, the imprecations of some and the prayers of
others, the roaring of the guns, and the hopes and fears that
pervaded the wounded, formed a very shocking scene, and
is still deeply impressed on my memory. But nothing
shocked me so much as the cold hard voice of the surgeon:
&ldquo;I am too busy to count the wounded&mdash;say the cockpit is
full, and some bad cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took this to the Admiral, who was back on the poop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
with men and spars dropping all round him. He took no
notice of me: all he said was, &ldquo;I think their fire slackens,
Mr. Vassall,&rdquo; addressing one of our lieutenants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, sir: many of the crew have deserted
their guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not, it must be observed, talking of the <i>Aquilon</i>,
the ship which had dealt us such awful mischief, but of the
<i>Spartiate</i>, which we were engaging. He took no notice of
the <i>Aquilon</i>: we hardly returned a gun to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louis will see to that,&rdquo; he said (Captain Louis was of
the <i>Minotaur</i>, the next in our line): &ldquo;I am engaging the
<i>Spartiate</i> till she strikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down came the tricoloured flag, and &ldquo;Cease firing&rdquo;
resounded all along our decks.</p>

<p>Our Captain himself had but half a cocked hat, the other
half having been carried off by a round shot that entered
his cabin when he had gone to serve out something to a
couple of seamen, and drenched it with their blood. Mr.
Galwey, our First, and a party of marines, were sent to take
possession.</p>

<p>Before this the fire of the <i>Aquilon</i> had slackened off, for
the <i>Minotaur</i>, which had engaged her, gave her such a
terrible yard-to-yard gruelling that the heart was taken out
of her fighting. This was fortunate, for we had to send for
her captain to receive a dying message from the Admiral,
who wished to thank him for the way he had saved our
ship by laying himself alongside of the <i>Aquilon</i>. We could
not have stood that raking many minutes longer.</p>

<p>I have not described the mighty exploits of our captains
who conquered the French centre as such should be
chronicled, for we of the flagship were confronted with an
event before which any other incident of the battle seemed
but of small importance, for the Admiral was struck down,
as we feared, mortally wounded.</p>

<p>He was walking on the deck, exposing himself like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
commonest sailor, as was his wont, when a flying piece of
iron from a charge of langridge struck him upon the upper
part of the forehead, and cut a great piece of skin at right
angles. This hung down over his face, covering his seeing
eye, and further blinding him with the terrific stream of
blood. He was at the time, though it may scarcely be
credited in the midst of such a terrible cannonade, calmly
examining the rough sketch map of the Bay which had
been found in a French ship by Captain Hallowell; and
he afterwards made a jest of the French taking a mean
advantage of him, and hitting him when he was not looking.
But he did not jest at the time; he just reeled and fell into
the arms of the Captain. I was by him, of course, for I was
still on this duty, and distinctly heard him say, &ldquo;I am
killed! Remember me to my wife!&rdquo;&mdash;a circumstance which
I always did remember, contrasting it with what he said at
Trafalgar about Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to judge Lady Nelson: indeed, I have
not seen her above once or twice, when she seemed to me
the ordinary Admiral&rsquo;s wife, whom one would meet in such
a place as this in which I live, in times of peace. What
faults she had were just the faults such a woman would
have, and they included the fault of being totally unable to
satisfy such an intense, imaginative, romantic temperament
as the Admiral&rsquo;s. I was in service under that great man
for years, and I think that the whole episode of his unhappy
marriage, and his much reprobated relation with Lady
Hamilton, may be summed up in the fact that his was a
nature that demanded to be monopolised by a woman.
How to monopolise, Lady Nelson neither knew nor cared,
and there was ready to step into her place one of the most
remarkable and companionable women of history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am killed! Remember me to my wife,&rdquo; cried our
beloved Admiral; and instantly Will and I and two or three
others&mdash;the hard, cold Will, with tears streaming down his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
face&mdash;ran to Captain Berry&rsquo;s assistance, and carried him
down to the cockpit.</p>

<p>The surgeon, hearing who it was, flew to him; but
he cried out, &ldquo;No, I will take my turn with my brave
fellows,&rdquo; and immediately afterwards he added&mdash;&ldquo;Do not
waste your time over me. I am a dying man. Tend
those who can be saved, and call me the chaplain.&rdquo; And
when the chaplain came he told him twice over to carry
his dying remembrance to Lady Nelson, and to summon
Captain Louis from the <i>Minotaur</i>, which was just ahead
of us, and had saved us from the tremendous raking of
the <i>Aquilon</i>. Captain Louis came very quickly, and the
Admiral thanked him as the saviour of his ship. The
captain could only hold out his hand in silent sorrow.
The Admiral bade him an affectionate farewell. &ldquo;And
now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whatever may become of me, my mind
is at peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surgeon then insisted on examining his wound,
which he found, except for the concussion, to be of a trifling
nature, though it was some time before he could convince
the Admiral of this. But as soon as he had done so, the
Admiral sought for some means to allay the tremendous
excitement under which he was naturally labouring, while
winning so glorious a victory, so he began to write a despatch
to the Admiralty. The secretary, who was himself wounded,
was so affected by the Admiral&rsquo;s condition that he was unable
to guide his pen, so the Admiral sent for the chaplain, and
though he came almost immediately he grew so impatient
of waiting for him that he commenced to write himself, with
his trembling left hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;Almighty God has blest His Majesty&rsquo;s
arms&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; He had written but little when Captain Berry
came down to report that the French Admiral&rsquo;s flagship, the
tremendous <i>Orient</i> of 120 guns, was on fire; and, severely
wounded as he was, the Admiral instantly staggered up on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
deck, where the first consideration that struck his mind was
concern for the danger of so many lives.</p>

<p>But now I must return to the progress of the battle. And
here I may remark that in only one instance did a British
ship fail to get a signal advantage of the Frenchman engaged,
and that, oddly enough, was the <i>Bellerophon</i>, which afterwards
became so historical. And she paid for her temerity
in engaging a ship so tremendously her superior in number
of guns as the <i>Orient</i>, which mounted 120 to her 74, the
disparity in weight of metal being almost double as great.
But she held on to the <i>Orient</i> like the British bull-dog that
she was, till her masts and cables having been entirely shot
away, she drifted out of line to the lee side of the Bay, and
was saved in spite of herself.</p>

<p>The five ships which engaged the French on the outside,
where they had concentrated their force, should naturally
have suffered the most severely, as indeed the <i>Bellerophon</i>,
the <i>Majestic</i>, our ship, and the <i>Minotaur</i> did; but the <i>Defence</i>,
like the <i>Zealous</i>, bore charmed lives. She had but four
men killed and eleven men wounded, though she laid herself
alongside of the <i>Peuple Souverain</i>, almost as close as we lay
to the <i>Spartiate</i>. Her immunity illustrated the value of the
Admiral&rsquo;s theory of concentrating your force on part of
the enemy and risking the rest. Instead of having the fire
of a second Frenchman raking her bows, as we had, she
was engaged with the Frenchman which had a second
English ship, the <i>Orion</i>, pouring broadsides into her almost
undefended larboard side. The <i>Majestic</i>, too, which was
the only ship that lost her captain, owed her great loss to
fouling the <i>Heureux</i> as she passed on to her duel with the
<i>Mercure</i>, which resulted in the latter&rsquo;s capture.</p>

<p>The <i>Zealous</i> was wonderful. She had but one man
killed and seven wounded, and preserved even her rigging
so uninjured that she alone of all the fleet was in a position
to chase the two unengaged French ships of the line, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
the two frigates which made their escape the next morning,
and yet she had been in the first of the fight.</p>

<p>The battle was practically won in the first few minutes.
The action did not begin till forty minutes past six, and by
fifty minutes past the <i>Guerrier</i> had been dismasted and
captured, and ten minutes after that the <i>Spartiate</i> and the
<i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i> were almost dismasted and ready to be taken
possession of, while the <i>Aquilon</i> and the <i>Peuple Souverain</i>
were taken possession of at half-past eight.</p>

<p>By the overpowering of the first three ships the fleets
were ten to ten when night closed in at seven o&rsquo;clock. This
was partly neutralised by the <i>Bellerophon&rsquo;s</i> drifting out of
action, shortly before the <i>Orient</i> blew up, a good deal owing
to her fire, though she was blown out of action herself.</p>

<p>But this in turn was neutralised by a fortunate accident.
As I have mentioned, the <i>Culloden</i>, <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Swiftsure</i>
were some miles from the rest of the fleet when the action
commenced, but the former saw and at once abandoned her
prize, and the latter, too, were signalled to return. The
<i>Culloden</i>, running down the wind, naturally had the advantage
of the others, which were beating up, but it was dark before
any of them could approach. Now, there was not a man in
all our fleet, saving the Admiral, with such a stomach for
fighting as Captain Troubridge; and in his anxiety to support
his chief, he did not proceed with quite the coolness of
Captain Foley, of the <i>Goliath</i>, who led our van in rounding
the shoal, and shared with the Admiral the credit of keeping
such a steady and seamanlike course when every minute
reduced our chance of taking up our anchorage by daylight.
Captain Foley of course had daylight, and Captain Troubridge
had not; but Troubridge was essentially a fighter,
willing to take any number of risks in the face of an enemy.
The result was that the <i>Culloden</i> stuck on the tail of the
shoal, and lay there bumping heavily. The loss of such a
formidable fighter as Captain Troubridge probably saved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> and the <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, the two French ships
of the line which got away on the following day; but he
himself generously said that he believed it helped to win
the battle, by letting such good men as Captain Ball and
Captain Hallowell, who were certainly two of the finest
captains in the fleet, sail straight on into the battle without
having to feel their way&mdash;which they did, for the <i>Culloden</i>,
hanging on the edge of the shoal and exhibiting lanterns
and other signals, served as a kind of lighthouse.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that men like Captain Ball and
Captain Hallowell passed their stranded consort without
the endeavour to tow her off, on which the little <i>Leander</i>
of fifty guns had already been engaged for some time; but
Captain Troubridge was soon convinced of the hopelessness
of the task, and rightly judged that the instant arrival of
three ships in the battle was of more consequence than
trying to deliver his own ship. They therefore, though
very unwillingly, cast off and proceeded to take their places
in the line.</p>

<p>As I have said, the fortunate accident of their deferred
arrival crushed the French centre. For when the <i>Orient</i>,
although she had blown the <i>Bellerophon</i> out of action,
discovered that her poop was on fire, up came two of
the best ships and the stoutest captains of our Navy, not
to mention the little <i>Leander</i>, which did yeoman&rsquo;s service
on that day. The <i>Swiftsure</i>, Captain Hallowell, at once
anchored on the <i>Orient&rsquo;s</i> starboard bow, while the <i>Alexander</i>,
taking advantage of the defective ordering of Admiral
Brueys which left five hundred yards between each pair
of ships, passed under the stern of the <i>Orient</i>, and raking
her with a terrific broadside, reserved after the English
fashion till she was within a few feet, took up her position
on the great ship&rsquo;s inner quarter. Both English captains
noted the fire on the French flagship, and training their
upper guns on the spot where it was raging, effectually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
prevented any attempt to save the ship. With their
flagship as helpless as a bee in the meshes of a couple of
spiders, the misfortunes of the French did not cease, for
the cables of the <i>Peuple Souverain</i> being shot away, she
drifted from her position to the quarter of the <i>Franklin</i>,
where she was raked by the <i>Orion</i>. Her drifting also left
a gap of a thousand feet in front of the <i>Franklin</i>, of which
the fifty-gun <i>Leander</i> took advantage with the utmost
coolness, calmly anchoring across the bows of the French
eighty-gun ship, and raking her with broadside after broadside.
And thus the battle raged till just about ten o&rsquo;clock,
when the <i>Orient</i>, which like the <i>Heureux</i> and <i>Tonnant</i> had
been completely in our power for some time, blew up.</p>

<p>The French ships who were on her lee had slipped their
cables and drifted some minutes before this, but Captain
Ball resolutely refused to budge before the destruction of
the <i>Orient</i> was made inevitable, as a result of which portions
of the burning ship fell upon the <i>Alexander</i>, and indeed
ignited one of her &lsquo;tops,&rsquo; which was happily extinguished.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Orient</i> themselves, except such as were
engaged in trying to extinguish it, had not noticed it until
a dense volume of black smoke suddenly burst up from
below, and with it a great flare of flame, which rose from
the quarter-deck, giving the ship the appearance of a
volcano, and reached the mainsail. Those who were on
the <i>Alexander</i>, which hung on to the <i>Orient</i> up to that
minute, say they never saw anything more awful than the
faces of the doomed hundreds on which the glare was
reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What boats have we, Berry?&rdquo; inquired the Admiral,
when he staggered up in the midst of his own agony.
Now that his execrated French were helpless, the prey of
the fire or the deep, he had only one thought and that was
to save them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have only a cutter, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
&ldquo;Lower away, first Lieutenant in charge; and you,
Trinder, go with him and steer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh God! it was a sickening sight. The sea was covered
with struggling sailors; our boats under a tremendous fire,
which the guns, that had been left loaded as the men
scrambled up for their lives, sent forth, were full to sinking.
At length we came to the point when we could not take
one more; and it was all we could do, by putting on a
racing stroke, with the sharp fall of the oars rendering it
unsafe to approach, to keep ourselves from being pulled
under.</p>

<p>Under the stern of the burning ship, to get away from
the shot of the 120 guns, were to be seen hundreds of men
swimming and floating on spars: the other French ships
had all gone too far off to help, giving a wide berth to the
expected explosion of the magazines; but as fast as they
could come, the boats from the English ships, regardless of
all danger, loading with the swimmers, dashed into the very
mouth of destruction to receive those who were unable to
swim, and hung on to the blazing ship to the last. The
flames now shot high above the masthead, reminding me
of the picture of Vesuvio worked in silk by one of the
foretopmen, which hung in the Admiral&rsquo;s state-room. It was
very terrible, joined to the cries of the young, the groans
of the wounded, and the shouts and yelling of the burning.
I think the shrieks will ring in my ears for ever; and the
darting of the forked flames from yard to yard and mast to
mast, until they soared above the clouds and illuminated
the most minute object, making all as distinct as the meridian
sun, and the numberless sinking and struggling sailors,
made up a veritable pandemonium.</p>

<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the great ship, that gave an idea of a
world in conflagration, blew up. There was an awful pause
and deathlike silence for about three minutes, when the
wreck of the masts, yards, and so on, which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
carried to a vast height, fell down into the water and on board
the surrounding ships. A port-fire fell into the main-royal of
the <i>Alexander</i>, but the fire occasioned by it was extinguished
in about two minutes by the active exertions of Captain
Ball, who, meaning all along to stand by, had been sluicing
his decks and rigging. After this awful scene the firing
was recommenced with the ships to leeward of the centre
till twenty minutes past ten, when there was a total cessation
of firing for about ten minutes; after which it was
revived till about three in the morning, when it again
ceased. After the victory had been secured in the van,
such British ships as were in a condition to move had gone
down upon the fresh ships of the enemy, which occasioned
these renewals of the fight, all of which terminated with the
same happy success in favour of our flag.</p>

<p>At five minutes past five in the morning the two rear
ships of the enemy, <i>Le Guillaume Tell</i> and <i>Le G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>,
were the only French ships of the line that had their
colours flying. At fifty-four minutes past five a French
frigate, <i>L&rsquo;Artemise</i>, fired a broadside and struck her colours;
but such was the unwarrantable and infamous conduct of
the French captain that, after having thus surrendered, he set
fire to his ship, and with part of his crew made his escape
on shore. Another of the French frigates, <i>La S&eacute;rieuse</i>,
had been sunk by the fire from some of our ships; but
as her poop remained above water, her men were saved
upon it, and were taken off by our boats in the morning.
The <i>Bellerophon</i>, whose masts and cables had been entirely
shot away, could not retain her situation abreast of the
<i>Orient</i>, but had drifted out of the line to the leeside
of the bay a little before that ship blew up. The
<i>Audacious</i> was in the morning detached to her assistance.
At eleven o&rsquo;clock <i>Le G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> and <i>Le Guillaume
Tell</i>, with the two frigates <i>La Justice</i> and <i>La Diane</i>,
cut their cables and stood out to sea, pursued by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
the <i>Zealous</i>, Captain Hood, who, as the Admiral himself
has stated, handsomely endeavoured to prevent their
escape; but as there was no other ship in a condition
to support the <i>Zealous</i> she was recalled. The whole day
of the 2nd was employed in securing the French ships
that had struck, and which were now all completely in
our possession, <i>Le Tonnant</i> and <i>Le Timol&eacute;on</i> excepted; as
these were both dismasted, and consequently could not
escape, they were naturally the last of which we thought
of taking possession.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd, although the time and
attention of the Admiral and all the officers of his squadron
were very fully employed in repairing the damages
sustained by their own ships and in securing those of the
enemy which their valour had subdued, yet the mind of
that great and good man felt the strongest emotion of the
most pious gratitude to the Supreme Being for the signal
success which by His Divine favour had crowned his
endeavours in the cause of his country; and, in consequence,
he issued the following memorandum to the respective
captains of the squadron:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<i>Vanguard</i>, off the Mouth of the Nile,<br />
<span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;<i>2nd August, 1798</i>.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Almighty God, having blessed His Majesty&rsquo;s arms with
victory, the Admiral intends returning public thanksgiving for
the same at two o&rsquo;clock this day; and he recommends every
ship doing the same as soon as convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ta01.png" width="300" height="55"
alt="Handwritten signature - Horatio Nelson" />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>At two o&rsquo;clock accordingly on that day, public service
was performed on the quarter-deck of the <i>Vanguard</i> by
the Rev. Mr. Comyn, the other ships following the example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
of the Admiral, though perhaps not all at the same time.
This solemn act of gratitude to heaven seemed to make
a very deep impression upon several prisoners, both
officers and men; some of the former of whom remarked,
&ldquo;that it was no wonder we could preserve such order and
discipline, when we could impress the minds of our men
with such sentiments after a victory so great, and at a
moment of such seeming confusion.&rdquo; On the same day
the following memorandum was issued to all the ships,
expressive of the Admiral&rsquo;s sentiments of the noble
exertions of the different officers and men of his squadron:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<i>Vanguard</i>, off the Mouth of the Nile,<br />
<span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;<i>2nd August, 1798</i>.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Admiral most heartily congratulates the Captains, Officers,
Seamen, and Marines of the Squadron he has the honour to
command, on the event of the late Action; and he desires they
will accept his most sincere and cordial Thanks for their very
gallant behaviour in this glorious Battle. It must strike forcibly
every British Seaman, how superior their conduct is, when in
discipline and good order, to the riotous behaviour of lawless
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Squadron may be assured the Admiral will not fail, with
his Dispatches, to represent their truly meritorious conduct in
the strongest terms to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;HORATIO NELSON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd, the <i>Timol&eacute;on</i> was set fire
to, and <i>Le Tonnant</i> had cut her cable, and drifted on shore;
but that active officer, Captain Miller, of the <i>Theseus</i>, soon
got her off again, and secured her in the British line. The
British force engaged consisted of twelve ships of seventy-four
guns, and the <i>Leander</i> of fifty.</p>

<p>I have often wondered if Buonaparte, who was with the
army landed from that fleet, witnessed the battle from the
shore. I cannot recall that he makes mention anywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
of having done so; but I cannot conceive a general who
took such minute note of every little incident in his own
battles resting content without seeing a battle which he
knew to be in progress, and certain to affect his fortunes
in such a wonderful way. If he did, he must have been
impressed by the knowledge that there was one element
which he could not command, and which might always mar
his fondest schemes.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span>&mdash;How the Admiral
began his friendship with
Lady Hamilton.</h2>


<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Letter from Lady Hamilton to the Admiral.</span></p>

<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<i>Naples, September 8th, 1798.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My dear, dear Sir,&mdash;How shall I begin? What shall
I say to you? &rsquo;Tis impossible I can write, for since last
Monday I am delirious with joy, and assure you I have a
fever caused by agitation and pleasure! Good God! what
a victory! Never, never has there been anything half so
glorious, so complete! I fainted when I heard the news,
and fell on my side, and am hurt. But what of that?
I should feel it a glory to die in such a cause. No, I
would not like to die till I see and embrace <em class="nonit">the victor of
the NILE</em>. How shall I describe to you the transports
of Maria Caroline? &rsquo;Tis not possible. She fainted, and
cried, kissed her husband, her children, walked frantic
with pleasure about the room, cried, kissed and embraced
every person near her, exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, brave Nelson!
Oh, God bless and protect our brave deliverer! Oh!
Nelson! Nelson! what do we owe to you! Oh, victor,
saviour of Italy! Oh, that my swollen heart could now
tell him personally what we owe to him!&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You may judge, my dear sir, of the rest; but my
head will not permit me to tell you half of the rejoicing.
The Neapolitans are mad, and if you was here now you
would be killed with kindness. Sonnets on sonnets, illuminations,
rejoicing. Not a French dog dare show his
face. How I glory in the honour of my country <em class="nonit">and my
countryman</em>! I walk and tread in the air with pride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
feeling that I was born on the same land with the victor
Nelson and his gallant band. But no more. I cannot,
dare not, trust myself, for I am not well.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Little dear Captain Hoste will tell you the rest. He
lives with us in the day, for he will not sleep out of his
ship, and we love him dearly.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He is a fine good lad. Sir William is delighted with
him, and says he will be a second Nelson. If he is only
half a Nelson he will be superior to all others.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I send you two letters from my adorable Queen. One
was written to me the day we received this glorious news;
the other yesterday. Keep them, as they are her own
handwriting. I have kept copies only; but I feel that you
ought to have them. If you had seen our meeting after
the battle&mdash;but I will keep it all for your arrival; I could
not do justice to her feelings or my own, with writing it.
We are preparing your apartment against you come. I
hope it will not be long, for Sir William and I are so
impatient to see and embrace you.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I wish you could have seen our house the three nights
of the illuminations: it was covered with your glorious
name; there were three thousand lamps, and there should
have been three millions if we had had time. All the
English vied with each other in celebrating this most
gallant and ever-remarkable victory. Sir William is ten
years younger since the happy news, and he now only
wishes to see his friend to be completely happy. How he
glories in you when your name is mentioned! He cannot
contain his joy. For God&rsquo;s sake come to Naples soon!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We receive so many sonnets and letters of congratulations.
I send you some of them, to show you how your
success is felt here. How I felt for poor Troubridge!
He must have been so angry on the sandbank&mdash;so brave
an officer! In short, I pity all those who were not in
the battle. I would have been rather an English powder-monkey
or a swab in that great victory than an emperor
out of it. But you will be tired of all this. Write or
come soon, to rejoice your ever sincere and obliged friend,</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
<span class="dropcap">T</span>HE man we brought up from the albergo near the
Castel Nuovo to the Ambassador&rsquo;s palace in an Embassy
coach, softened with a mountain of cushions, did not,
to the ordinary onlooker, give much idea of the man
who, as darkness was falling, hesitated not a moment to
sail without a pilot or a chart between the French line
of battle and a shoaling shore. But we, who were privileged
to see that extraordinary man during every hour
of his daily life, were well accustomed to the spectacle of
him prostrated with sickness&mdash;from which, however, the
chance of a battle would rouse him, like the sound of a
trumpet, into the martial, alert little figure that seemed to
the men who were to follow his orders to death, like the
angel who came down to smite the hosts of Sennacherib.</p>

<p>In spite of his prostration from fever and wounds, he had
insisted on donning his full Admiral&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;he was
going to visit the Representative of his Sovereign, and to
the day of his death he never spoke of King George III.
save as Our Good and Great King.</p>

<p>Will and I were of his party&mdash;Will was in his own
coach: his touch soothed the Admiral more than any in
the ship, though it was not to be in requisition so much
thereafter. I was to do kind of orderly&rsquo;s work, which
would in ordinary cases be performed by some one before
the mast; but the Admiral, with the kindness which never
failed, judged that Will, being away from the ship, would
like to have a mate, and that I should serve best.</p>

<p>The palace was hardly like the generality of palaces of
that date, for the great state staircase of red marble which
conducted to the principal rooms&mdash;they, as is the wont in
Italy, being on the first floor and not level with the ground
as in England&mdash;was inside the palace instead of winding
round the courtyard outside the inner face of the quadrangle.
Perhaps I should hardly call the palace a quadrangle,
for on the bottom, or sea-side, the buildings were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
only the height of a garden wall, and used, I think, for
horses. The stables were certainly under the palace on
this and the adjoining side towards the town.</p>

<p>The Ambassador&rsquo;s palace, I should have said, was on the
outskirts of the town, at the bottom end of the Strada S.
Caterina and just against the King&rsquo;s Villa, which was not a
house as it would sound to our English ears, but a garden
with palm trees, and avenues of the ilex, and with many
statues of white marble, running along the sea-shore
between the city and Mergellina.</p>

<p>We were on a little hill, which I could see pleased the
Admiral greatly, for a faint smile came over his face.
This was one of his worst days.</p>

<p>No sooner had the carriage pulled up at the great door,
than there flew out the most beautiful woman I ever
saw, gracefully dressed in a cool muslin robe of the
Turkish fashion, and with a jewelled chaplet bearing the
inscription &ldquo;Nelson and Victory&rdquo; in the curly hair, so
full of auburn lights that at times it looked of the gold
colour Mr. Romney was so fond of painting. I needed not
to remark the perfect oval of the dimpled face, nor its
fairness and rosiness, so marvellously blent that people
refused to believe it genuine till her fondness for sea-bathing
parties set it beyond doubt, nor the most exquisite
smile ever preserved on canvas, to know that it was My
Lady Hamilton; for no sooner had she seen the Admiral
than her laughing eyes grew moist and tender, and the
corners of her mouth began to droop pitifully, and in a
moment she had her arm round the Admiral&rsquo;s back and
under his right shoulder, with such a gentle, sympathetic
touch that he moved from the carriage into the door almost
without pain. Behind My Lady was a tall, somewhat
bent, elderly gentleman, wearing his Order of the Bath
and sundry Neapolitan decorations, like the Admiral, in
full Court dress. This was, of course, Sir William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Hamilton, K.C.B., his Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Ambassador and
Plenipotentiary at the Court of the Two Sicilies. It has
often seemed to me, since, mighty significant that the
reception of the Admiral into the palace of the Hamiltons
should have been conducted with so much ceremony. You
can hardly imagine the procession of coaches and servants
sent to bring us up from the albergo, and the army of
servants drawn up by the gate and courtyard and grand
staircase of the palace; for seldom has the entry of a
conqueror into a fallen city been attended with results that
have led to more writing. I must say that, as she supported
the Admiral from his coach to the suite prepared for him
on that day she might have been a goddess: she was so
far beyond any woman that I had seen in beauty and
graciousness and tenderness, and soft, floating movement.</p>

<p>As he moved down from his coach, I saw the spirit of
action coming over the Admiral. He had caught sight of
his hostess, and was straightening himself up&mdash;there never
was a body so dominated by its spirit. But before he
could finish My Lady had flown to him, and quelled him
with a woman&rsquo;s tender solicitude for sickness. She saw
in an instant through his little artifice of leaving his hair
unbrushed off his forehead. It was there the plaster yet
lay on the wound which had struck him down in the
battle. But though he yielded to her tenderness, and
moved up the broad, low stairs with the imperceptible
advance of the sick unto death&mdash;he took two or more steps
on each stair&mdash;his spirit was perceptibly rising, and to us
who knew him this was eloquent. She would have him
not to talk; but he said thrice, &ldquo;Thank God! thank God!
thank God!&rdquo; And the spirit of woman&rsquo;s curiosity overcoming
her, she said, &ldquo;Tell me for what, Admiral, and
talk no more.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;As I lay in my albergo, in that
cursed low ground round the port, with its air like the
breath of human beings, I lifted up mine eyes to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
hills, and I know that from this little hill cometh my
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pondered on these words, for they had a ring about
them that was not natural to the Admiral&rsquo;s simple and
direct way of speaking. It was not extraordinary for him
to wax sentimental, or to embellish his speech with
allusions to classics, such as I have recorded about the
Fountain of Arethusa; but &ldquo;cometh&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; were
not in his style. But recalling that the Admiral was a
parson&rsquo;s son and deeply religious after his own fashion, I
made inquiry of the chaplain, Mr. Comyn, who told me
that it came from a favourite Psalm of the Admiral&rsquo;s&mdash;the
cxxi., I think&mdash;which he was in the habit of calling &ldquo;the
Traveller&rsquo;s Psalm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir William had made all preparations, with a sedan and
specially chosen bearers, for having him carried from his
coach to his chamber; but Lady Hamilton, with finer tact,
perceived that if he could mount on her arm, though it
might take an hour, it would be good to give him the
feeling of recovery. And so it proved, for I do not think
that he received injury from this fatigue.</p>

<p>The palace was so vast that it took us many minutes
passing down the west wing to the chamber chosen for
his sleeping-room, which lay at the very end of the suite
set apart for him. When we were arrived, he insisted on
moving up to his bed, which lay only a yard or two in
from the far or south-west corner. He steadied himself
against one of the left-hand posts at the foot of the
bed, exclaiming, &ldquo;I shall get well here&mdash;I shall get well
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, if aspect affects the health, he might get
well, for the prospect from the bed was one which beggars
my poor powers of description; though I suppose that the
view from the hill of Pausilippo is even finer, for from it
one can see the rifted hill, the great fire-mountain Vesuvius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
whose eruptions form one of our links of sympathy with
the ancient world. It was slumbering that day peacefully
amid the lately-dug-out ruins of Forum Pompeji, and the
flat-topped hillocks which yet cover two other ancient
cities, and half a dozen thriving modern towns swarming
with people, as well as the magnificent castle of St. Elmo,
which completely dominates the city. These, and the
Castle of Nuovo, were shut off by the towering rock which
was the Acropolis of the ancient Parthenope, round which
the new city&mdash;Neapolis&mdash;grew up.</p>

<p>But the windows of the Admiral&rsquo;s chamber commanded
view enough for any mortal man to desire. In the distance
were the long line of mountains culminating in the snow-topped
St. Angelo, twice as high as Vesuvius, which divides
the Bay of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno, and, in the
jaws of the Bay, Capri; while nearer in were the Castel
dell&rsquo; Uovo rising up sheer from the drawbridge running out
from Santa Lucia; the hill of Pausilippo, with its white
villas peeping out from dark trees; and between them the
royal garden with its feathery palms and ilex avenues.</p>

<p>Above all there was the Bay of Naples, surely the bluest
piece of water under heaven, with its calm clear waters
almost reflecting, far out as they were, the stately ships
which had just anchored, after winning the greatest sea
victory the world ever saw. The tall spars and black
and white hulls were thrown into relief by the swarm of
Mediterranean craft with their high-peaked noses, tall
lateen sails of glowing reds and yellows, and red-capped
crews. From his very bed the Admiral had his fleet, and
every atmospheric change in the Bay, under his own eye.
I could see how he appreciated the thought which prompted
his being put where he need have no worry about what
was happening to his beloved fleet. And when he had
feasted his eyes for a minute or two on the glassy blue
water under the shining sky, he cried, &ldquo;Thank you, dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
friend&mdash;a thousand times, thank you!&rdquo; And he repeated,
&ldquo;I shall get well here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must tell you that the whole ship&rsquo;s company had been
most seriously concerned about the health of the Admiral.
The wound he had in the head in the battle, though it was
only from a heavy splinter, produced a sort of concussion
of the brain; and this, with the business of so great an
affair, even after our glorious victory was gained, combined
with his natural proneness to sickness, produced a most
dangerous fever, which was like to have carried him off in
any one of the fifteen hours immediately before we cast
anchor in the Bay of Naples, though in the two or three
weeks we were sailing up the Mediterranean by way of
Candia he was more than once seemingly full recovered.</p>

<p>After we had brought him to the Ambassador&rsquo;s palace
I felt confident that he would mend. A spell on shore
always did much for his general health, and we could
see that under Lady Hamilton&rsquo;s direction he was like
to have the best of attention. As it turned out it was
marvellous what she did for him. The very next day he
was fit to crack a jest about the diet of asses&rsquo; milk, which
was judged to be the only nourishment light enough for a
digestion so disordered by fever. &ldquo;What would the French
say?&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;I can picture the Paris lampooner
drawing me with asses&rsquo; ears in a lion&rsquo;s skin, imagining
myself to be the nobler animal. Yes, to the French I shall
always be the ass nourished on asses&rsquo; milk who thought
himself a lion!&rdquo; And then he went off into one of his
peals of laughter&mdash;rather a shaky peal it must be confessed&mdash;but
then a straw will serve to show which way the wind
blows.</p>

<p>What set him up above all (and set us up too, you may
be sure&mdash;the Admiral&rsquo;s secretary, Will and myself, and
generally one or two of the captains) was the pains My
Lady took to keep his mind from troubling about his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
condition. The ship surgeon, had he been a landsman,
might have been expected to be flat against it, after the
manner of most doctors, and to have prescribed rest, complete
rest, seeing no one, darkened rooms, and so on; but Michael
Jefferson was a man of a different stamp. It was his
business to make men fit for duty again with as little rest
as possible. And then he knew the Admiral. What would
that eager, never-resting, planning mind have done in a
darkened room, where he could see nothing, cut off from
all friends who could give him any news of his fleet? He
would have imagined, to say the least of it, a French fleet
entering the Bay, and he not being on his ship to have the
honour of beating them. In short, he would have harassed
himself into his grave.</p>

<p>My Lady went to the root of the matter at once: &ldquo;It is
not rest he wants,&rdquo; she maintained; &ldquo;it is not physic he
needs, but dieting carefully and treating like a spoiled child.
I must do the spoiling,&rdquo; she said, with that smile which lit
up her whole face and made her eyes so soft; and I could
vow that when she used those words she had not a thought
of their ever being any more than friends.</p>

<p>I have read somewhere a fairy tale in which people were
waited on by invisible servants, so that the dishes took and
left their places on the table as it were of their own accord,
and in perfect silence. It was, in a sort, after this manner
that the Admiral&rsquo;s wants and pleasures were supplied.</p>

<p>The room being at the end of a wing had windows upon
three sides&mdash;west and south and east; and each window,
of course, had heavy close lattices of a dark green colour,
as well as projecting awnings of a striped canvas, which
could be raised or lowered at pleasure. By aid of these the
Admiral could have as much tempered sun as he desired
almost from sunrise to sunset; and it seemed as if he never
could have his fill of sun. He often said in after years with
regret, that <em>living</em> meant living on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
The windows opening on three sides, and the nearness
of the sea also, gave always a pleasant current of air; and
in this great airy chamber, always kept cool, and always
full of gracious sunshine, with noiseless hands and feet a
succession of diversions were provided in the same unobtrusive
way by the hostess herself. For though it was
the Admiral&rsquo;s bed-chamber, after he had had his light
breakfast served in the morning, it was really more of a
reception-room, where, as he felt well enough, he transacted
the business which was so near his heart, where a
great man and son of Anak like Captain Troubridge might
be seen waiting and watching with the affection of a
woman.</p>

<p>My Lady was famous for her deep, soft voice. She would
be singing and singing a room or two away for the Admiral
to hear her, as it were by accident; and he would lie and
listen, and she would sing until the dream was broken by
some mischance. At another time she floated into the
room unobserved, carrying in her hands a long Indian scarf
or shawl, and went through the &ldquo;Attitudes,&rdquo; a species of
tableaux vivants for which she was so celebrated.</p>

<p>The Admiral was resting, and did not see her for some
time after she had begun; and we, not feeling sure that
he did not sleep, though I think she had made sure, stood
trying to express by dumb show our astonishment and
applause. The Admiral gave no sign beyond opening his
eyes dreamily; but he told her afterwards that he had
never seen illusions so perfect, grace so absolute, beauty
so divine. But I think he was most moved when she stole
in to his side to bring him flowers or grapes, or a healing
ptisane, and stayed smoothing his pillow, laying cool bandages
on his wounded head, taking his hands in those
magnetic hands, which were so smooth and yet so strong,
and in a rich, low voice&mdash;not asking how he <em>felt</em>, but telling
him of all the pleasant things prepared for him to do in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
day or two, when the surgeon had pronounced that he
should be ready&mdash;telling him what king and people alike
were saying about their liberator, telling him this good jest,
and that, with a woman&rsquo;s reverence for a hero.</p>

<p>It pleased him to have her sit by him, for her &ldquo;magnetism&rdquo;
was marvellous; and she would sit by the hour as patiently
as though she had been his mother&mdash;amusing him if he
would be amused, listening to him if he would talk, or
writing his letters, if he desired it, to his wife; and I, who
witnessed it all, think that at that time there was nothing
in her mind but pure woman&rsquo;s hero-worship, and I could
not help crying to myself, &ldquo;What a man, and what a
woman!&rdquo; This man had re-writ the history of Europe
with his famous sea-fight, in which he had taken risks such
as no man ever took before in the world, and was withal
as sympathetic as a woman; and this woman led even the
chaplain to exclaim that she had, what the ancients prized
above all things, that mysterious quality of <small>VENUSTAS</small>, which
he endeavoured to explain to us as sheer loveliness&mdash;the
possession of all the graces which went to form their
conception of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.</p>

<p>And so within a few days the Admiral was about and able
to attend, in some fashion, the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> given day and night in
his honour (and much to his inconvenience), the principal
of which were the grand ball given by Count Esterhazy, and
the ball of the British Ambassador on the 29th, which was
the Admiral&rsquo;s birthday, and of which more anon.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span>&mdash;What happened
at the Ball given by Lady
Hamilton in honour of the
Admiral.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>O one is ever likely to forget the entertainment given
by the Ambassador and Lady Hamilton in honour
of the Admiral&rsquo;s birthday. Eighty sat down to
dinner, mind you, in a private house; but I will not attempt
to describe by hearsay what happened there&mdash;the toasts
that were given, the <i>furore</i> with which they were received;
for, naturally, I was not present, being only a midshipman
at the time. But at the ball which followed I was present
from the opening to the end, and it was a truly wonderful
affair. There were about seventeen hundred present, and
eight hundred of us sat down to supper, and the supper
was rich enough to have been a dinner.</p>

<p>There was more dancing here and at Count Esterhazy&rsquo;s
ball than there had been at Syracuse; for many English of
consideration went to Naples in those days, and the ladies
of high Neapolitan society had made it a fashion to learn
the English dances; but the midshipmen and the younger
lieutenants, fresh from the sea-fare of a long cruise, supped
more than danced. You can be sure that there was no
lack of toasting, for which the Admiral&rsquo;s stepson, Josiah
Nisbet, whom he always treated as his own son, was a fair
mark. Some one coupled a toast with his name, and the
jest took, and after that he had no respite; and before the
night was over Josiah had taken a good deal more than his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
share of the Ambassador&rsquo;s very excellent wine, and had
become well accustomed to the sound of his own voice.</p>

<p>But even boys cannot sup all night, and slowly we found
our way back towards the ball-room. I passed in with
Josiah, for I had not Will with me, he being in attendance
on the Admiral, and indeed at no time disposed for drinking
parties: they would not allow of the barrier of reserve
which it was his intention to maintain.</p>

<p>Well, as we passed on our way into the ball-room, we
saw Will standing alone in an ante-chamber and made for
him, only to find him posted at a gentlemanly distance from
the Admiral, who was sitting on a couch with his left arm
stretched over the end, and My Lady with her right hand
on his empty sleeve pouring out a woman&rsquo;s hero-worship
with soft speech and glistening eye and gentle attitude.
Right-down hero-worship I felt convinced it was. Every
one in Naples was intoxicated with Nelson, and she
above all, who from the time his fleet was come into the
Mediterranean, had wrestled with all her might and main
to second his efforts to find and finish the French. Indeed,
we have it in the Admiral&rsquo;s writing that it was owing to
her aid in the matter of getting the ships watered that we
ever got to the Nile in time.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that she was asking him for the fiftieth
time how he felt when he took the risk of sailing between
the French and the shore&mdash;between the French and their
anchors, or how he felt when the <i>Orient</i> blew up, or was
telling him he was the greatest hero that ever lived. But
Josiah thought otherwise, and swashing up to the Admiral
in the most offensive style, struck an attitude before him,
and began another of the speeches which had been affording
us such excellent entertainment while we were supping,
as he grew braver and braver with his wine. The language
he used I shall not repeat. It was the request of the
gallant Captain, whose conduct crushed out the spark which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
threatened such a blaze, that the officers who were present
should not repeat what they had heard. But as there have
been many allusions to the incident since, I do not think
that I shall be betraying confidence if I give a general
outline of it as I had the pain of seeing it. The general
tenor of it was that he called upon the Admiral in the
name of &ldquo;my mother and your wife&rdquo; to tear himself
from the embraces of that &mdash;&mdash;, and here he applied to
My Lady the epithets for which silence was desired, as
I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I do not say but that at a later period some sort of
remonstrance might have come with fair grace and proper
spirit from Josiah in the name of his mother, the Admiral&rsquo;s
wife, anent Lady Hamilton; but at this period I feel certain
that it was wholly unjust and uncalled for, and that it was
so is proved by the very cordial relations existing a few
months later between Josiah and that remarkable woman,
who added to her other magnificent qualities a fine
forgivingness.</p>

<p>For the moment all Naples might have gone ablaze with
the British Admiral and the British Ambassador set by the
ears over an alleged intrigue of this kind, and the work of
the Battle of the Nile might almost have been undone so
far as the Two Sicilies were concerned. I looked to see
what Will would do. It was one of the few occasions in
his life upon which I have ever seen him waver. The
position was certainly difficult. The Admiral&rsquo;s stepson
was his senior in rank, and the outrage being offered to
the Admiral was, in a way, a family affair, in which a
stranger might be considered to have no right to interfere.
On the other hand, the Admiral being but one-armed and
lately recovered of a fever, could not turn Josiah out of the
room, and Will had for some months been treated by the
Admiral as if he were his own son. Indeed, the Admiral&rsquo;s
relations with Will were of a more unbroken and cordial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
nature than his relations with Josiah; but as Josiah went
on raising his voice and crying out more and more outrageous
things, Will quitted his hesitation and was advancing
with set face to do&mdash;I tremble to think what&mdash;when he
found himself pushed aside by a big, burly form in a
post-captain&rsquo;s uniform; and, to our intense relief, we saw
Captain Troubridge and Captain Ball rush into the room.
Troubridge, the Admiral&rsquo;s brother-in-arms for a quarter of
a century, took in the situation at a glance, and, affecting
to consider the whole matter a drunkard&rsquo;s folly, caught
Josiah up in his herculean embrace, and carried him off
kicking like a naughty child. To his own ship, I think, for
the Captain did not appear again, although his not appearing
may have been due to the idea that he could thus escape
the discussion of so difficult a matter, which would have
been almost inevitable if he had been near the Admiral
again that night.</p>

<p>The most affecting part, for us of the fleet, was the
feeling that it was our duty to stand by until the matter
with Josiah was settled. The Admiral hated shirking an
ordeal above everything in the world. It was to him a
form of cowardice, which he called the root of all evil. He
himself was absolutely undeterred by risk or responsibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Admiral, &ldquo;I fear that I must leave
this hospitable home to-night.&rdquo; This we heard with our
own ears before we left to follow the two Captains and
the struggling Josiah to the grand stairway, where a look
from Captain Troubridge&rsquo;s eye told us that we should go
no further.</p>

<p>What happened after this was, of course, known only
to the Admiral and Lady Hamilton, seeing that ordinary
manners prompted the withdrawal of all spectators from
the ante-room in which this deplorable incident took place.
For occasions like this I shall quote from the Admiral&rsquo;s
Journal, which came into Will&rsquo;s hands under such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
extraordinary circumstances. I cannot vouch for its authenticity,
coming through such hands; but Mrs. Hunter certainly
seemed to us three witnesses to be giving a truthful
account. And as I have said, to us who knew the Admiral
so well&mdash;his temperament, his habits, his mode of expressing
himself, and the turns of his handwriting&mdash;the Journal
presented every outward evidence of being genuine, though
to Will it seemed well-nigh impossible that the Admiral
should have filled three such bulky volumes without his
ever having occasion to suspect their existence.</p>


<p class="centerpad"><span class="smcap">Extract from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal, dated Sept. 30th,
1798.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I take up my pen as the only object to which I can
make confession. Heretofore my confidante has been
Lady Nelson. Since our marriage I have written to her
in the fullest and freest manner upon all matters personal
to me; but something prompts me not to vex her with the
matter. She is the best creature in the world; but her
mind is of the slower kind which does not, at a glance,
distinguish between what is essential or merely accidental.
She would have made no commander, though she could
have been trusted to defend her post till Death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most unfortunate occurrence happened last night.
My stepson, Josiah Nisbet, of whom I had written to his
mother when we were in Naples before, to say that Lady
Hamilton had been so wonderfully kind and fond of him,
introducing him to all manner of exalted people, and
taking him everywhere as her escort in her carriage, chose
to make an extraordinary exhibition of himself last night.
The young man had been supping with his messmates at
a ball Sir William and Lady Hamilton had given in my
honour; and he had, I doubt not, partaken too freely of
the potent South Italian wines. He was decidedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
unsteady, when perceiving me, as he returned from the
supper-room, sitting by Lady H., in the presence of others,
he reeled up to us, applying the grossest epithets to her
Ladyship, and insinuating that relations existed between
us incompatible with my character as a gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no reason for stifling the truth to you, my pen,
and you will be content with my plain asseveration that
all which he insinuated was gross falsehood. Unfortunately
to you only, or to Sir William, who persists in ignoring
handsomely the whole incident, can I discuss the matter.
I could not write of it to Lady Nelson without raising
the very suspicions which justice demands should be
allayed; and my rank makes it impossible for me to
consult my oldest friends, like Troubridge, who occupy
positions under my command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I am not a bad man to have passages in my
behaviour which it is not expedient to discuss with my
wife. I have now lived thirty-nine years, and I have
ever, I think, been eminently amenable to the gentle
influence of women. But, not even excepting the young
lady at Quebec whom I should have left the service to
marry, becoming a fellow-settler with the United Empire
loyalists in Upper Canada, if it had not been for the wise
persuasions of my valued friend Alexander Davison, I
have never known but two of them in the intimate fashion
which is open to landsmen. I am telling the strict truth
when I say that I never kissed a lady until I married
Lady Nelson, nor after till within this few days; though
what harm there be in it I know not, if it be conducted
in decent and not outrageous fashion. It seems to me a
natural mode of expression of sympathy between a man
and a woman who are friends sufficient, and I feel confident
that I never did it before solely from the fact that my
seafaring life, up to the time I was married, prevented
my forming a friendship close enough to require such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
expression. And in the years that I was on shore before
St. Vincent, my life was filled with the friendship and
companionship of my wife and father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now a day above a week since I landed in Naples
more dead than alive; and that I am now alive, though
very unwell, and weary of this country of fiddlers and
poets, and &mdash;&mdash;, and scoundrels, is due, I may say, solely
to my Lady Hamilton, who took me into the Embassy
and by giving me the best chamber in Naples for an
ailing man, and the best-chosen nourishment, and her
own unremitting attention, gave me life and strength for
this very trying week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has ever been my belief that in making and keeping
men well&mdash;I am speaking now of ships&rsquo; crews exposed
to the ailments that come of prolonged cruises, such as
scurvy and the rest&mdash;the keeping them entertained plays
the most important part; and for this reason I have
promoted all manner of diversions and educational exercises
among them. And this is the treatment my Lady applied
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fever with which I was prostrate at my landing
is now intermittent; and though I wake every morning
with a headache raging, and shaking fits, and a most
disordered tongue, with proper care, as the day wears on,
I regain my strength, and am passably fit to be taken
to this and the other banquet and festa in the evening&mdash;things
which I hate, but cannot refuse for fear of giving
offence and damaging His Majesty&rsquo;s Service. There is
not only Their Majesties to consider, but the Ambassadors
of the friendly Powers, and the leading nobles. These
last are very important; for it cannot be denied that though
the <i>lazzaroni</i> and the humbler class generally are devoted
to the good Queen and her husband, there is among the
younger members of the noble families a wicked and
pernicious tendency to welcome the new and infernal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
doctrines begotten in France. I do not myself believe that
they are with the French at heart, but there is in the
mind of the educated Italian a certain levity which makes
him scoff at anything established, be it religion or the
laws of his country, and disposed to trifle with the last
new toy in theories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am writing at too great length that which is only
written for the writing, and never to be seen of the public
eye; but I feel that I must defend myself to myself, since
it is the first time that my conscience has doubted me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was necessary that I should attend these assemblages,
whose miserable conduct maddens my irritable
temper. But I could not have done it were it not for the
goodness, the overpowering goodness, of Lady Hamilton.
Not only has she given me this chamber and nourished me
with this extreme care, but every morning she would do
something to take me out of my poor wretched self, to
stop the thumping my head gives from the hurt I had
at the Nile. One morning, after light refreshment had
been brought in and I had eaten what I could, and lay
back on my pillow trying, by closing my eyes, to hide
myself from the pain and feeling of sickness, while Comyn
and Campbell and Will and the boy [myself&mdash;T.&nbsp;T.], and
perhaps Troubridge, were standing or sitting round in
affectionate and respectful silence, waiting for me to be
able to raise my head and give directions for the ordering
of the squadron, I heard Lady Hamilton&rsquo;s glorious rich
voice singing in some part of the palace at the distance to
be soothing; and as a morning or two later, I mended, I
opened my eyes to see her, before an enraptured audience
expressing their applause with silent admiration, in those
Attitudes all Europe has heard of for their wonderful grace
and fidelity to what they represent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then as the day advanced, and I had back strength
enough to be dressed, and had got through the business of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
the fleet, she would have me come into her own salon,
the pleasantest room in the house after my chamber, to
rest upon a couch until it should be time for the midday
meal, which they take here in Naples very early. While
I was on the couch she would pull one of the long Italian
stools by my side, and, half sitting, half kneeling on it in
the most graceful attitude in the world, leaning her elbow
at times on my couch for the balance, read or talk or be
silent, as my mood was, and if my head troubled me,
press it gently but firmly with her hands, which were
very full of restoring energy. She would do this, which
is very fatiguing when done from below, until she had
charmed away the pain by some hand-healing powers
well known to the Italians. And when it was over, and
I was dozing off, she would rest her own head against
me. At first this was to snatch a moment of needed rest,
but it soothed me. The contact with her, I think, carried
on that current of energy or sympathy which I found so
curative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&mdash;no, I cannot think it was wicked of me to
caress with my fingers that beautiful head which was so
kind to me; to train back the auburn curls running over
it, when they strayed in front of her little pink ears;
to press it lightly with my lips in the hope that she
would just perceive and the hope that she would just
not perceive this suggestion of gratitude and appreciation.
Only yesterday morning, after a week of this tender
nursing, her head was a little nearer to me; and feeling
that this was the last of such mornings, I being now
sufficiently the better to be able to resume my ordinary
day, I ventured to press my lips firmly upon the bright
hair just above the noble forehead,&mdash;so intellectual, so
exquisite, in the contour of its brows,&mdash;intending to signify
gratitude for her care, and the end of my pleasant ailing.
But she would not have it, and, in its place, turned up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
me her face, the very type of rosy beauty, and radiant
with tenderness for my infirmity. My infirmity, alas! of
another sort was not proof, and I kissed her tenderly,
gratefully and respectfully, and taking her hand in mine
held it for I know not how long, pouring out my thanks
for her goodness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those were the beginnings, the foundations for what
happened last night in consequence of Josiah&rsquo;s really outrageous
behaviour. It might be supposed that something
of this had come to Josiah&rsquo;s ears and caused the outbreak.
But I have no shadow of reason for believing so. Having
free access to me in my chamber and elsewhere, he knew
that Lady Hamilton was nursing me, but that there had
been any kind of tenderness between us he was not aware.
He is, however, of a violent and jealous disposition, and
being now a man, and inflamed by her gracious beauty, he
cannot but remember how she caressed him and never had
him out of her company when he was a boy and we were
last in Naples; and he is maddened by her countenance
being totally withdrawn from him now, not from any fault
she has against him, but because she has turned herself
into a nurse for my recovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has, I suppose, learned of her betrayal when she
was little more than a child; though I hardly know it myself,
not being disposed to listen to tales bringing the impeachment
of an unfortunate past against the present position of
those I respect, especially if they be my benefactors. The
gross epithets he applied to Lady Hamilton last night must
allude to this buried past, and the insinuations against my
conduct must have been based upon the same. He was
robbed of his reason by wine until he was incapable of
distinguishing; and then gave vent, by making coarse and
impossible suggestions, to his irritation at her previous
kindness to him being lost in the devotion she has shown
to my nursing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
&ldquo;I felt inexpressibly pained and outraged, and was quite
at a loss what to do in keeping with the respect due to her
Ladyship and my position in His Majesty&rsquo;s service, when
trusty Troubridge, hearing the heated voice, flew in and
literally carried him off. I think I may say that my pain
and shame were shared by all present, for almost before I
could notice, the anteroom was empty but for our two
selves, and the doors gently closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sitting on a kind of couch, with Lady Hamilton
at my right side, when J. flung himself before us. She
rose with womanly dignity to stand up, as it were, for her
good and virtuous name. I had already sprung to my feet
to confront the young ruffian, and until he had been carried
off, and we were left, she maintained her courage wonderfully.
But when the occasion had passed, and we were
alone, she almost fainted; she could hardly stagger back to
the couch. I never saw such womanly emotion. I flung
myself on my knees in front of her and entreated her not
to lose her courage now that the storm was past, but the
tears poured from her eyes and she was the very picture of
womanly weakness. In vain I tried to persuade her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strange fire had been running through my veins
all day since that meeting in the morning. I felt as elated
as if I were a god. There was enough indeed to elate
me without that: it was my fortieth birthday, and I could
remind myself that before my fortieth birthday I had
won the Battle of the Nile. In honour of my birthday
the Ambassador and Lady H. had given a party of
unprecedented magnificence. Above eighty sat down to
dinner; above seventeen hundred not only accepted, but
came to the ball which followed. Supper was laid for
eight hundred. In the ball-room there was a rostral column
erected in my honour under a magnificent canopy, never to
come down while we remain at Naples, and the Ambassador
whispered to me that he had it on good authority that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
should have a peerage at least, if not a viscounty. In
the middle of the entertainment, &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; was
sung, without foreknowledge on my part, by the crew of
my barge, with an additional verse in my honour writ by
Miss Knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this until that boy&rsquo;s conduct threatened to pull
down the house about my ears! The King and all his
court were there, too, lavishing compliments upon me
which I felt to be extravagant, though I was sensible that
I had probably saved his kingdom for him. The whole
room buzzed with my name. &lsquo;H.&nbsp;N.&rsquo; or &lsquo;Nelson and
Victory,&rsquo; met my eye everywhere, and the room was full
of the heroes who had won my victory for me, and yet
offered me its whole honour. It was a marvellous night,
and if it had been in London and not in Naples, with my
own nation round me, surely no mortal man could have
known a more intoxicating moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this until that boy!... And yet I can confess to
you, Pen, that in the midst of all this justifiable elation, I
did not forget what had happened in the morning when
that glorious beauty had been held up for the moment for
my kiss of friendship. I could not help reminding myself
that a new friendship had begun for me of an intoxicating
sweetness, not known to me in my earlier friendships: a
friendship in which sympathy of the mind and tastes was
accompanied by the light touch which I had previously
associated with the beginnings of first love, and not with
the more solid sympathies of friendship. All this until
that boy....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found myself on my knees before Lady H., endeavouring
to persuade her from her tears, and I was
startled to find that the sense of elation which I had
ascribed to the unparalleled honour showered on me
through the evening, and now abruptly broken off by the
unfortunate incident, continued hardly diminished. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
then the mad spirit of temptation entered into me to try
and kiss the lovely, tearful face, willingly surrendered to
me for that moment in the morning, into forgetfulness of
the humiliation. I kissed the eyes and cheeks, and then
the unresisting lips, and made I don&rsquo;t know what hot
protestations of sympathy to win her from her shame.
And at the last I succeeded; for, kissing me back, she
rose from her tears radiant like Venus rising from the foam
of the sea, and said, &lsquo;Let us forget it, Admiral: to-morrow
he will be all penitence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is to-morrow, and <em>I</em> am all penitence. I wonder
if I am very wicked? I know that I am intoxicated with
the companionship of Lady H., but I know too that I
have no feelings which are not of the purest. Is it wrong,
under these circumstances, to appreciate the affectionate
companionship of such a woman among women? Or were
we intended to be happy, and in a world in which so much
of happiness depends upon the affectionate companionship
of women, to enjoy whatever such companionships come in
our way without impurity?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day or to-morrow I shall sail away to Malta. It
needs my presence, and I shall be away from this miserable
court, which is still more distasteful to me now that I
no longer feel myself to have the right of despising my
neighbours for their views.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not feel that I can stay in this house longer.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>I remember the emotion with which I first read this
portion of the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal: it cleared things up for
me a little. For I had often wondered how such a man
as the Admiral with his lofty soul had first become entangled
with My Lady. I have often spoken with her, and she
was uniformly kind to me as a boy. She called me her
good Tubby, and I liked her so well as to like it. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
was indeed the best-hearted woman in the world, infinitely
good to us midshipmen and the younger lieutenants, or I
don&rsquo;t know how we could have stood the spectacle of
our beloved Admiral at the feet of a woman, however
distractingly lovely.</p>

<p>She was at this time distractingly lovely. She was
indeed no longer quite slender; but being of a good height,
and her throat and arms being of an exquisite colour and
form, her <i>embonpoint</i> had only the effect of superb softness
and roundness&mdash;though her movements were said to be a
little stiff when she was off her guard. She had such an
unwearying spirit, such a fine actress&rsquo;s gift for remembering
the part she was playing, that I never at this period of her
life remember seeing her off her guard in this matter, though
I have seen her at balls and revelling suppers, and in the
most awful storm at sea which it was ever my lot to
witness in all my years of service. That any woman in
all the long reign of his late Majesty, the longest in our
English history, had a face of such intoxicating beauty I
hardly believe; its shape and moulding were perfect. In
particular the arching of the brows and the way her lips
parted as she smiled were miracles, and such teeth I never
saw both for their colour and the way they were set. And
when she was smiling, with these teeth glittering like
snow, and soft dimples in her lovely cheeks, and kindness
rising from her eyes like the fragrant smoke of incense,
she was the most graciously beautiful piece of womanhood
in the wide world. She had, too, the habit of lightly
laying her hand on you as she spoke, or if you were
walking, slipping it a little way through your arm and
taking a few paces with you. And she had a fascinating
sense of delight in her own beauty, without any trace of
the arrogance and spoiled child&rsquo;s pettishness which so
frequently accompany it. Indeed, she craved to have the
warm liking of all who came into contact with her. Knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
now the temptations to which she had been exposed in her
bringing up, and her habit of blindly obeying merely her
own instincts in the matter of right and wrong, I cannot
but give her the highest credit for the constancy and
exclusiveness with which she bestowed her heart. Though
she was gracious and had a manner to all, she never
loved&mdash;she never showed herself in love with but three
men: Mr. Greville (whom I never saw&mdash;but I hear that she
gave him all the best of her heart), Sir William, and the
Admiral.</p>

<p>While he was on shore now, she was courier as well as
hostess to the still ailing Admiral. With that immense
establishment of the British Embassy on her hands, no
matter what the time of day, or what the function was that
required to be attended, all he had to do was to take his
place beside the smiling beauty, and find himself at the
point where his duties began. She was the centre of life,
the ear and tongue of royal favour at Naples.</p>

<p>A man like the Admiral, so inexhaustible in emergencies,
but so prone to sink back into a low state of vitality between
whiles, was more than ordinarily likely to slip into such
an arrangement easily. Attending state banquets and galas
was always peculiarly exhausting to him, except where he
had some diplomatic problem that roused his energy, or
companionship in which he delighted.</p>

<p>By what I knew of the Admiral I do not see that there
is anything in the portion of the Journal above quoted
which might not have been written by him. The sole
difficulty is to account for the existence of such a journal
without his trusted Will ever having seen a trace of it, in
his constant personal attendance.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XI.</span>&mdash;How the Admiral
entered the maze of Neapolitan
Politics.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ARIA CAROLINA, Queen of Naples, was more of a
man than her husband, though he was of great
stature and much addicted to the chase. The
daughter of Maria Theresa, the sister of Marie Antoinette, it
was not surprising that she should have beauty and
capacity in no common degree. History has it that she was
of coarser fibre than her mother and sister; it was perhaps
necessary for the part she had to play. Marie Antoinette
could be reckless, Maria Carolina is said to have stopped at
nothing which stood in the way of her desires, except that
she was loyal in her friendships and her hatreds.</p>

<p>After a lengthy period of a kind of social purgatory,
Lady Hamilton had been admitted into the truly Oriental
paradise of the Neapolitan Court. The Queen did not do
things by halves. When once her Ladyship had been
admitted to the court, she was rapidly admitted to the
Queen&rsquo;s intimacy. My Lady&rsquo;s beauty and high spirits, her
usefulness in the <i>al fresco</i> entertainments in which the King
and Queen delighted, and for which she had a perfect
genius, and her extreme popularity, made her desirable to a
dissolute court which lived in the frankest way for pleasure.
And every one knows now that she served the Queen in
another capacity, unsuspected by any except those in her
confidence and that of the British leaders at Naples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
The kingdom of Naples, or the Two Sicilies, was on the
point of being swallowed up by France. The British fleet
apart, it was practically at the mercy of the French, for
though it had a certain number of men capable of offering a
bloody resistance in guerilla warfare or street fighting, we
now know that it had no army or navy capable of contending
with the veteran and splendidly-led forces of France. The
nobles and the wealthier portion of the population, to a
large extent, believed in the honesty of the French intentions,
and, as I have said, had a good deal of sympathy
with the new ideas spread on the air by the French
Revolution. The King did not see the danger in which his
kingdom lay from the French. But the Queen&rsquo;s wits were
sharpened by her hatred: she never forgot for an instant the
murder of her sister or the sympathies of her family&mdash;the
Imperial House of Austria. Being on the <i>qui vive</i>, she saw
the sword which was hanging over the kingdom, and with
characteristic energy determined to dash it away.</p>

<p>But there were difficulties, and she saw that she must
lean upon the English and their brilliant naval commander.
The island part of her kingdom could hardly be seriously
invaded until the British sea power in the Mediterranean
was broken; but the Continental part was in a very different
position. There were French forces no farther off than
Rome, and until our sweeping victory at the Nile had
shut the great French expeditionary force under General
Buonaparte up in Egypt it was more than half likely that
it would have been employed for a descent on Naples. The
English, on the other hand, had no land forces in Italy,
and we had not indeed shown that we had either
commanders or regiments of a character to maintain the
prestige won under the great Duke of Marlborough. Any
formal defiance of the French, therefore, involved a grave
risk of losing the Continental part of the Neapolitan
kingdom, until an Austrian army marched down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
Peninsula. And to bring about a French invasion it was
only necessary for the Queen to show herself in open
alliance with the English. No one doubted her wishes in
this direction. She was simply overborne by the sympathy
or fear for the French entertained by those who had the
power to override her.</p>

<p>Maria Carolina had more than ordinary courage; but she
had cunning also, and quietly developed her plans in connection
with the English, and contrived to do so, as history
has proved, and certain of us knew all along, through her
intimacy with Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton, it is true, was the wife of the British
Ambassador; but, partly from her antecedents, no doubt,
people did not regard her as capable of having any political
weight, and she was much identified with the frivolities
which took up the time of the Royal Family to such an
extent as to be a scandal.</p>

<p>Maria Carolina was supposed to be concealing her chagrin
and drowning her cares in a turmoil of pleasure, with a
questionable entourage made more questionable by the prominence
of My Lady. But all this elaborate frivolity, besides
serving the immediate purpose of passing the time agreeably,
left My Lady in constant attendance on the Queen. They
might be for hours together on a water picnic to eat the
fine oysters fattened in the Lucrine Lake of the ancients,
and the making up of the party might involve My Lady
driving up to the Palace twice or thrice in the course of a
few hours to consult with the Queen for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Never for an instant did the French party suspect that
My Lady was the go-between from the Queen to the
British Ambassador or British naval officers; but we know
now that this was in progress for many months. And the
assumed intimacy led to a real and deep friendship, for
the Queen was astonished with My Lady&rsquo;s masculine
capacity and still more masculine courage in this difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
business, and touched by her devotion to the Royal House
of Naples. Accordingly she lost no opportunity of showing
her attachment to her friend by lending her presence to
My Lady&rsquo;s entertainments, especially when the Admiral&rsquo;s
victory allowed her to throw off the mask and display
openly her sympathies for the English against the French.</p>

<p>At this birthday ball given in honour of the Admiral,
she was present for the greater part of the evening, surrounded
by a glittering bevy of courtiers; and her presence
gave My Lady the opportunity of showing her brilliant
courage and resourcefulness. I learn from the Journals,
in a passage full of admiration for the well-bred serenity
with which she met such a terrible ordeal, that no sooner
had she left the Admiral after she had recovered from her
emotion at the outrageous accusations of Lieutenant Nisbet,
than he received a summons from the Queen graciously
commanding his attendance.</p>

<p>Not having any sufficient excuse to decline, he went, and
found My Lady tattling with Her Majesty as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I interpret for your Majesty and his Excellency?&rdquo;
she inquired in the most ordinary way; and when the
Queen replied in the affirmative, informed the Admiral
that this was Her Majesty&rsquo;s wish, and added that she had
prompted Her Majesty to send for him, and that it would
not be usual for him to take his leave until Her Majesty
gave the signal, thus securing him from doing anything
hastily in connection with the incident. At the door the
Admiral found Will waiting for orders, and, with characteristic
command, showing a face devoid of any expression
but the smiling respect with which he invariably greeted
his chief when he met him or was sent for. Telling him
to attend, the Admiral waited on Her Majesty, when,
finding that they were to converse privately, My Lady
interpreting, Will fell back among the less important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
members of the royal party, and seeing at a glance that
there were no English among them to whom courtesy
demanded that he should pass a few remarks, he retired
within his shell, as it were, and stood with unseeing eyes.
He was glad to keep silence, for the events which had just
happened had shocked him even more than the Admiral
himself. Impressionable and emotional as the Admiral
was, an attack was in itself calculated to make his spirits
rise, though the nature of this attack, from the fact that it
was levelled chiefly against a lady for whom he felt such
an attachment and respect, stood in the way of his natural
tendency on this occasion. Neither had Will the Admiral&rsquo;s
philosophy, deeply tinged with a religiousness on the one
hand and lightened with an intermittent gaiety on the
other. Will, except in action, had a slow-moving mind,
which many things failed to reach, but when they did reach
it, or were of a serious nature, he could not easily shake
them off. As he stood giving the rein to his thoughts, he
took little note of those among whom he was standing until
he heard himself addressed, and found that he was next the
Prince of Favara and his sister. There was a genuine ring
in the Prince&rsquo;s voice, as if bygones were really bygones,
and the salutations were not merely a piece of duellists&rsquo;
etiquette when the combatants happened to meet again.
Donna Rusidda, too, greeted him as if she were glad to
see him.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Will would, as likely as
not, have found some well-bred way of escaping from a
position which threatened to be awkward for both of them;
but he was so agitated about the affair with Lieutenant
Nisbet that he had not his usual collectedness, nor was it
easy for him, being in attendance upon the Admiral, to place
a distance between himself and the Favaras who were in
attendance upon the Queen.</p>

<p>The topic of conversation started by the Prince was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
naturally, the battle, in which it was already bruited about
Naples how Will had distinguished himself. After repeated
congratulations, in which Donna Rusidda joined very
prettily, they talked to him for a long time about the battle,
Donna Rusidda asking most particularly about the Admiral,
and how he was now, and about his wound, and how he
looked in the action, and so on, in infinite detail. The topic
was a fortunate one; for Will so warmed up on the
subject of his beloved Admiral that they left off quite
kindled into friendship.</p>

<p>It was against Will&rsquo;s notions of good breeding to question
them very particularly about themselves; but in reply to
his query whether they would be in Naples long, the Prince
volunteered the information that a certain number of the
Queen&rsquo;s ladies had always to be from the island, and that
his sister had lately been chosen to fill a vacancy. He
himself had long been attached to Ferdinand I.&rsquo;s household.
He further showed his disposition to be friendly by making
a jest of his poverty. &ldquo;If one cannot afford to live in one&rsquo;s
own palace, the next best thing is to live in the King&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="centerpad"><span class="smcap">A Further Extract from the Journal.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The letter herein referred to as having been written
by the Admiral to her Ladyship on October 3rd, 1798, was
duly sent, and is preserved in autograph among the Nelson
papers.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our time here is actively employed, and between
business and what is called pleasure I am not my own
master for five minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunately a good deal of the business of the last few
days has been transacted with her charming Ladyship, who
came to me from the Queen to put me in possession
of a mass of information, which Her Majesty did not
consider it safe to entrust to paper. The spies of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
French party are so many and so active, even in the
Queen&rsquo;s own apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am easier in my mind now about Emma. I am
convinced that when a man and a woman of an age to be
mutually attractive to one another are fast friends and
frequently in each other&rsquo;s company, as those French would
say, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, that it is opposed to the laws of human
nature&mdash;I would almost go further, and say that it is
opposed to the laws of gravitation&mdash;that they should not
drift into close proximity with each other. And being
in close proximity, it is as much a law of nature that they
should from time to time lay sympathetic hands the one
upon the other. Whether they also kiss is upon a different
footing; for kissing has so long been employed as the
formula to express a certain state of things, though I
believe its particularisation to this to be purely arbitrary.
But the formula having been accepted will deter many,
especially women, from what would naturally seem a
harmless and proper mode of expressing the completeness
of their companionship and understanding of each other,
though now it seems a dreadful fault and sort of crime. I
am thankful that Lady Hamilton and I are not hidebound
by any such superstitions. This is not to say that I have
not had grave misgivings with my conscience, for it does
not seem right that any man should enjoy such perfect
happiness as I feel in the companionship of dear Lady H.
It is the happiness that I mistrust, not the holding of
friendly hands and meeting of friendly lips. And yet why
should one mistrust happiness? The patriarch Jacob, at
the end of his long life and reign as chief of his household,
exclaimed, &lsquo;Few and evil have been the days of my
pilgrimage,&rsquo; and he had lived then a hundred and forty
years. I have lived but forty, crowned at the end by the
goodness of God with a victory than which no mortal man
could pray for greater. But if the patriarch could describe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
his hundred and forty years in which he had founded a
prosperous family and, as God promised him, a great nation,
may I not rather apply these words to my forty years,
spent, three parts of them, on the sea, which I cannot, in
spite of so long a time, face without constant sickness? I
have fought in a hundred pitched battles, been wounded&mdash;I
know not how often&mdash;and lost an eye and an arm in the
service of my country. I have spent months together out
at sea, in a battered ship, badly provisioned. Have I not
earned whatever happiness Providence suffers to be put
in my way?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is Lady Nelson. She is a good wife: would
she not be glad that I should have the kindness&mdash;I put the
plain truth to myself&mdash;the caressingness of a good woman,
to coax back for me that coy and uncertain goddess of
health? Of course she would. Why do I not write to
her, then? Because, not being in the full possession of the
facts, she might misunderstand, and I might raise the very
suspicions which I should be writing to allay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful Emma! how diffident and girlish she was
when she came to me to-day, dreading lest she should be
disturbing me, dreading lest she should be intruding,
dreading lest she was trespassing on my friendship! And
the woman, who came to me with a frank kiss, brought
with her the secrets of a nation, which she set forth
better than Acton would have done, or her husband the
Ambassador.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have now, I think, before me the whole history
leading up to the present situation in the Neapolitan
kingdom. I have the attitude and treacherous designs of
the French, the policy of the Emperor, the state of the
kingdom. I think the presence of these French at Castellana
in the Roman state&mdash;thirteen thousand of them, better
troops, I should judge, than any the Queen can put in the
field&mdash;a most serious menace, not only for their power in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
the field, which she ought to be able to balance if she gets
a good general: there is one, I hear, to come from Austria&mdash;Neapolitan
commanders cannot be relied on. But the
principal danger lies not so much in their power in the
field as in the danger of their pernicious ideas, spreading
among the disaffected in the Neapolitan kingdom with a
knowledge of there being such a strong basis to rally on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that their Majesties can put into the field an
army of thirty or forty thousand fine troops, who will follow
their leaders anywhere, and not only out of the battle-field,
as they would certainly have to, if led by their own
commanders. With these one might dispose of the French
thirteen thousand in the Roman state, especially if one
could land a few thousand men at Leghorn to cut them off
from their base, and get the Emperor to march his armies.
But this is exactly what the Emperor is determined not to
do unless we force him, because he says that we must wait
for the French attack. Now this is what I never have done
in any of my principal actions. It has ever been my
custom to seek the enemy and deliver my attack at the
earliest possible moment, and I have found this answer
above expectation with the French, who always credit the
attacker with having the superior force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to write to the Queen or the Ambassador,
but am restrained by the fact that they have not asked me
formally to give any opinion, and it would be like pushing
myself into the command of their forces. But there is no
corresponding reason why I should not place a summary
of my views in the hands of Lady H., to be by her
communicated to the Ambassador and Her Majesty. I
shall write to her as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;&lsquo;Naples, Oct. 3rd, 1798.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The anxiety which you and Sir William Hamilton have
always had for the happiness of their Sicilian Majesties, was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
planted in me five years past, and I can truly say, that on every
occasion which has offered (which have been numerous) I have
never failed to manifest my sincere regard for the felicity of these
kingdoms. Under this attachment, I cannot be an indifferent
spectator to what has (been) and is passing in the Two Sicilies,
nor to the misery (without being a politician), which I cannot but
see plainly is ready to fall on those kingdoms, now so loyal, by
the worst of all policy&mdash;that of procrastination. Since my
arrival in these seas in June last, I have seen in the Sicilians the
most loyal people to their Sovereign, with the utmost detestation
of the French and their principles. Since my arrival at Naples
I have found all ranks, from the very highest to the lowest, eager
for war with the French, who, all know, are preparing an army
of robbers to plunder these kingdoms and destroy the Monarchy.
I have seen the Minister of the insolent French pass over in
silence the manifest breach of the third article of the treaty
between his Sicilian Majesty and the French Republic. Ought
not this extraordinary conduct to be seriously noticed? Has
not the uniform conduct of the French been to lull governments
into a false security, and then to destroy them? As I have
before stated, is it not known to every person that Naples is the
next marked object for plunder? With this knowledge, and that
his Sicilian Majesty has an army ready (I am told) to march into
a country anxious to receive them, with the advantage of carrying
the war from, instead of waiting for it at home, I am all astonished
that the army has not marched a month ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I trust that the arrival of General Mack will induce the
Government not to lose any more of the favourable time which
Providence has put in their hands; for if they do, and wait for
an attack in this country, instead of carrying the war out of it, it
requires no gift of prophecy to pronounce that these kingdoms
will be ruined and the monarchy destroyed. But should, unfortunately,
this miserable ruinous system of procrastination be
persisted in, I would recommend that all your property and
persons are ready to embark at a very short notice. It will be
my duty to look and provide for your safety, and with it (I am
sorry to think it will be necessary) that of the amiable Queen of
these kingdoms and her family. I have read with admiration
her dignified and incomparable letters of September 1796. May
the councils of these kingdoms ever be guided by such sentiments
of dignity, honour, and justice; and may the words of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, be instilled into the ministry of
this country&mdash;&ldquo;<em>The boldest measures are the safest</em>&rdquo;&mdash;is the sincere
wish of your Ladyship&rsquo;s, etc.,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;Your Ladyship will, I beg, receive this letter as a
preparative for Sir William Hamilton, to whom I am writing,
with all respect, the firm and unalterable opinion of a British
Admiral, anxious to approve himself a faithful servant to his
Sovereign by doing everything in his power for the happiness
and security of their Sicilian Majesties and their kingdoms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just made a copy of the letter to Lady H.,
sealed it, and sent it to her by Will&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">[This is really most extraordinary if the journals be not
genuine, for Will well remembers taking a letter to her
Ladyship on the date mentioned, which was afterwards
made public, and from the nature of its contents fits in
exactly with the extract from the Journal. And if one says
that the Journal may have been written up from the
published letter, how is one to account for Will&rsquo;s being
mentioned with the circumstances correct? For Will
was of no consequence then, being one of the younger
lieutenants only. This certainly is a most extraordinary
coincidence.&mdash;T.&nbsp;T.]</p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;I am not sure that I have made matters clear to a
woman, though of masculine intelligence. I trust that she
will come to me before she acts upon it; indeed, I shall
send for her. But shall I? I must ask myself, is it for
this that I desire her presence, or is it for the overpowering
joy of having her with me again? To be honest to
myself, I fear it is but an excuse, and yet the salvation of
Naples lies in the communications she carries between the
Palace and my fleet. I wish I knew....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only know that in this last week the whole tenor of

my life seems to have changed. I am tasting for the first
time of the larger, fuller life in which men and women
enjoy perfect companionship of each other. I hope there
is nothing wicked in it! I hope there is nothing wicked
in it! God knows I do it with a pure heart. He has said
that &lsquo;to the pure all things are pure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Much of this chapter is taken from an account of a visit to
&ldquo;Pompeii&rdquo; written in 1802.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Admiral &ldquo;found more to detain him in Naples
than he had anticipated.&rdquo; I write these words
with a smile: they were his own. We did not
sail for Malta till October 15th, and then we had to go all
round Sicily. My Lady, partly, I suppose, for reasons to
which I have already alluded, was never satisfied without
the Admiral went somewhere by <i>barca</i> or carriage. She
loved open-air parties, and I firmly believe loved the getting-up
of them as much as any part of the expedition. The
Admiral said, with the very best grace, that he was under
his hostess&rsquo;s orders, and she was so infinitely charming
and full of entertainment that it did not cost a man much
to be at her orders. In good truth, she tried to anticipate
every wish of his, except it might be that of leaving him
to rest in some pleasant corner of her palace within hail of
her voice. She certainly did not at this time plan for secret
meetings with him, though her manner was more caressing
to him in public than a prudent woman would have allowed
herself. For one kind of expedition he was always ready:
he was much interested in the monuments of Roman and
Greek history&mdash;especially Roman, for the Admiral had in his
heart a profound respect for the Romans as lords of the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
and as anticipating the place that he meant England should
have; and he had a sneaking contempt for the Greeks,
holding that they never fought like men save when they had a
bridge broken down behind them, or mere Asiatics opposed
to them.</p>

<p>The city of Naples is not rich in such monuments,
although the whole half of the bay, from Naples to the
ancient Misenum at the end of one of the enclosing horns,
is full of the villas and what not of the most famous people
of the court of C&aelig;sar Augustus. And there are at the foot
of Mount Vesuvius cities of late years begun to be excavated.
At Forum Pompeji especially there is almost a whole city
to be seen, and the ancients have told us so much about
the eruption which caused its destruction that every
traveller of intelligence who proceeds to Naples dare
scarcely leave it without having made an examination of
these ruins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pompeji first, Nelson!&rdquo; cried her Ladyship, coming
upon us while Will and I were taking our orders about
some matter. She had a most easy way of addressing men
on the shortest acquaintance. &ldquo;And we must go in <i>calesses</i>,
for our coaches would never get back alive from such a
road. I know not which are worst, the lava rocks you
rise over, or the lava sands you sink in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral was much gratified, and My Lady rattled on
merrily. &ldquo;We must have the Queen. The King does not
signify; he would make some reason to get off a-hunting,
if we had him with us. But the Queen we must have; for
they always dig up a new house or temple, or at least a
skeleton or two in a mould of lava, for royalty. We will
send for an army of workmen, and the Director. I suppose
we must have the Director, though we get to work much
the faster if we have not him to say &lsquo;Gently, gently,&rsquo; all
the while, and &lsquo;Use the sounding rod before the spade.&rsquo;
Yes, we must have the Queen, and she will bring so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
of her gentlemen and ladies; and we shall take how many?
You, Nelson, of course, and these boys, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Comyn, your Ladyship, my chaplain.&rdquo; He had not
yet commenced Emma, or dearest Emma, as he afterwards
used, in public. &ldquo;Mr. Comyn is my library,&rdquo; he added in
his gracious way, &ldquo;upon such matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Comyn must come,&rdquo; said her Ladyship, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have Troubridge: he turns so glum sometimes.
I&rsquo;ll go off and see the Queen for her to fix a day,
and whom she will have with her; and I must see who are
to be with me, and count how many <i>calesses</i>: we can only
put two into each if we drive ourselves or put the driver out
on the shaft; but they are fine, they give you a tossing
like a boat, with their high loose springs, but they will
weather any rock, and I assure you we shall have plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I shall cut a very sorry figure,&rdquo; said the Admiral;
&ldquo;sea-sick on land is shameful, and I am a very poor
sailor, your Ladyship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A fico</i> Nelson; you shall drive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall be wrecked at last, and I came near enough
in the <i>Vanguard</i> when we were reconnoitring off Toulon
before the race for the Nile. But I&rsquo;ll drive your Ladyship; I
never stayed in port for fear of shipwreck, and never will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was fixed for the next day. The heat signified but
little, for these <i>calesses</i> have large hoods, and the streets of
Pompeji are so narrow as to give some shade. I do not
know how many <i>calesses</i> there were&mdash;more than we could
easily count, as they met outside the palace over against
the church of S. Ferdinando. As the Admiral was fulfilling
his promise of driving her Ladyship, Will and I had a
<i>caless</i> to ourselves, and you may be sure that we enjoyed
it. Coming last, as being the least present, we had all the
fun of the fair; and every one was making much splutter,
because, though some were well used to driving, they were
mostly new to the handling of these see-sawing <i>calesses</i>. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
never in my whole life had the driving of anything but an
old pony and a shay: no more up to this time had Will,
though he afterwards prided himself on his horseflesh. But
the mere whipping up of a horse was fun enough for boys
like us; and if we had not had to keep our place in the
rear of the line, I think that we should have needed a deal
of picking up on that road.</p>

<p>I shall not describe how we made our royal progress&mdash;we
had the Queen with us, mind&mdash;out of the Capuan Gate
and past Portici, where their Majesties have a palace and
keep all the best of the things that are found in Pompeji,
even shaving the frescoes off the walls with a fine kind of
saw. Indeed, I was not able to observe much, for Will,
contrary to his usual wont, cried, &ldquo;You drive, Tubby!&rdquo;&mdash;which
I was at a loss to understand, until I espied that in
the <i>caless</i> in front of us, of which the hood would not stay
up, were seated the Prince of Favara and his sister.</p>

<p>Once or twice, when we halted perforce, for this or the
other reason of My Lady, ever a creature of impulses, I
was able to take my eye off my horse, which in the general
order, being the whip, I could not afford to do. When I
did so look up, I was not surprised that Will bade me
drive, for in all my life I never saw a woman with her
head so beautifully poised on her shoulders as Donna
Rusidda, and the heat brought the red into the clear cheeks
of that delicate face. Her hair, too, which was brushed up
after the fashion of the day into something very like the
mode used on the Greek coins, had the most enchanting
little curls at the top of her slender neck.</p>

<p>When we arrived at our destination, we all drove into
a spacious courtyard, on a level with and a few yards
distant from the high road, from which it is separated by
a large lattice gate, adjoining to the abode of the only real
inhabitant of the once magnificent and populous town of
Pompeji&mdash;the invalid soldier who acted as guardian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
guide to its remains, and who looked scared at the wholesale
invasion of his peaceful realm.</p>

<p>Her Ladyship had been true to her word in getting a
royal order for excavators, who turned up to an innumerable
extent, and their director. And there was, of course, our
escort: we had rendezvoused at the Palace because of the
necessity of taking a patrol of cavalry to protect us from
annoyance by the sympathisers of the French party.</p>

<p>No sooner were we dismounted, than Mr. Comyn felt
it his duty to improve the occasion. He began on the
vicissitudes of earthly grandeur: this very dwelling of the
Neapolitan veteran was once tenanted by a maniple of
those legionaries whose irresistible valour had subdued all
our hemisphere from the Tyne to the swampy banks of the
Nile, from the pillars of Hercules to the shores of India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Comyn!&rdquo; roared the Admiral, whom the Queen
encouraged to treat her as a friend rather than a sovereign:
&ldquo;what a rare <i>auspex</i>, is it you call it? No, <i>augur</i>, you
make. Why, since the fortunate event of the 1st of August
every one of these four points at this moment acknowledges
British sway; and not only the sea between them, but
every accessible corner, and the liquid part of the whole
globe, from Nootka Sound to Bass&rsquo;s Straits, is directed from
half a dozen valves in Charing Cross. But a truce to
national bragging, which I detest as much as individual
self-praise! It will only do by way of a claptrap at the end
of a dry stage-speech, well and significantly bawled up to
the forum or the galleries. No more of it in this place: let
us begin the sober narrative of facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Lud!&rdquo; said her Ladyship, &ldquo;is it so bad as that?
Your Majesty, may the excavators cast about and find a
good place to begin, that we may have something to see
while our ears are being tickled? A golden statue let it
be; not the same gold as the statue of Minerva, whose
head the peasant split open with a hoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
In the face of her Ladyship&rsquo;s protests the excavators
were marched off to a place out of sight; the plain reason
being that the part all round where we were was already
excavated down to its original level.</p>

<p>The quadrangular court which we first entered into might
be as large as the railed part of Leicester Square. It was
surrounded on all sides by a colonnade supporting the roof
of a gallery, and from the gallery you entered a number of
small apartments not unlike the cells of a prison, or, to use
an affirmative comparison, greatly resembling the galleries
round some of our old inns, with the rooms adjoining.
Only in the present instance the corridor was on the ground
floor, there being no upper storey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This building, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Comyn, after a lame
parley with the one-armed soldier, &ldquo;was first taken for a
gymnasium, afterwards for a prison, and by some for a
school of gladiators; at present it is declared to have been
a barrack for soldiers, because various pieces of armour
were found in some of the cells. The little apartments are
highly interesting. Many have their walls covered with
inscriptions and curious drawings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very curious,&rdquo; said the Admiral dryly, pointing to a
pencil sketch such as one notices on the dead walls in the
London streets which happen to have a national school near
them&mdash;the master or beadle or other obnoxious person being
represented by an outlined figure with straight lines for the
legs and arms, and some sort of an irregular circle for head
and body. This one had a nose added as well as an eye, and
his feet were represented by pothooks, and his hands by
toasting-forks, one of which held a straight weapon, looking,
it must be confessed, more like a rod than any sort of sword.
The letters of the inscription were all capitals, and although
not absolutely like our present Roman alphabet, might
easily be read, particularly by one who from Herculanean
MSS. had become a little familiar with antique penmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
This was Mr. Comyn&rsquo;s dictum, not mine, and the name
of the figure was Nonius Maximus.</p>

<p>The Queen bade Miss Cornelia Knight, who was one of
the party, and had a pretty talent for making poor sketches,
to do a drawing of the figure for Her Majesty; which produced
much merriment, for the one-armed guardian was
such a recluse in his charge out here that he did not know
his company. He at once rebuked Her Majesty, informing
her that he had strict orders from the Queen not to allow
the use of pencil, paper, or any writing or drawing materials
within the town of Forum Pompeji. My Lady, after first exchanging
confidential glances with the faithful servant, slyly
winked at the Queen with her left eye, while a repeated
gliding motion of her right thumb across the finger nearest
it made a certain telegraphic signal, and the Queen made
one who desired to serve her honestly a rogue, by giving
him some <i>carlins</i>, to be allowed to break the rules, which
she had made herself.</p>

<p>I could see that the Admiral was gravely shocked:
the idea of professional duty never left him in the most
incongruous situations.</p>

<p>On a sight-seeing expedition like this, it was in the
habit of my Lady, and, I was told, of the Queen, to do that
which might be least expected of them. If there were but
little to see, they would fly through it and back again, in so
short a space of time that all the elaborate preparations
should seem wasted; and if there was more to be seen than
a strong man could walk through on a long summer&rsquo;s
day, they would trifle by the hour at the very outset, as
they seemed like to do now. But the Admiral was of
a different mind. He had come to see the ruins so
wondrously preserved for nigh twenty centuries by the
mummifying ashes,&mdash;how these mighty Romans lived
whose ensample he was never weary of studying. His
acquaintance with their history was not indeed profound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
and in the studies of their antiquities he was even less
versed. But he had in his chaplain, Mr. Comyn, a ripe
scholar, with whom it was ever his wont to make all
possible inquiry about a place before he should visit it.</p>

<p>And My Lady, ever quick to feel the pulse of his desires,
and having the Queen accustomed to follow her impulses,
with a laugh, in one minute directed a forward movement.</p>

<p>The Admiral was much amazed at the smallness, nay,
meanness of the houses; and made inquiry if only the
dwellings of the shop-keepers and other baser sort of
persons had been in the town, the rich resorting to villas
in the outskirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the Director: &ldquo;this is a Roman
senator&rsquo;s house you have before you, and that which you
have but now examined belonged to one of the most famous
proconsuls&mdash;a class which of all others had the best opportunity
of enriching themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral was profoundly impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a people!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man who had ruled half
Asia came to end his days in a house which had no
windows and no door, but such as we give our servants at
the kitchen-back; which covered no more ground than a
cottage, and had, like a cottage, only the one floor, and had
in the whole of it but one room large enough for company.
How the great Romans, for whom the world was too little,
could bear to be cooped up in those little cells, no larger
than a cabin, in a climate like this passes my comprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All present agreed with him&mdash;as like as not their code
of manners demanded that they should appear to&mdash;all,
except the Prince Caracciolo, who was of the Neapolitan
Navy, and of the party. He was a man cut on the cross-grain,
and said, with a licence very unusual among Italians,
except when they are looking for a quarrel: &ldquo;If I could
persuade myself that these pig-styes were actually the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
work of Roman architecture I should feel no difficulty in
solving the doubts of my credulous English friend. It was
these very confined cells which made them so eager to get
abroad, and enlarge by conquest their elbow-room. And
the same reason induces us modern Italians who live in
comfortable, lofty, and spacious dwellings to remain where
we are, convinced, as we feel, that any change of abode
would only be for the worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince, it must be known, had a good estate in
Naples, at the corner of the Chiaja, where the road goes off
to Pausilippo, and bounding on that side the fine new
gardens of the Thuilleries, which the King had made with
pleached walks and a fair open space in the midst, to
display that wonder of antiquity, the Farnese Bull, which
came to him by inheritance a little since. Mr. Comyn did
not render his speech, knowing the Admiral&rsquo;s temper, and
the avoidance of quarrels commending itself to him as a
clerk in holy orders. It was a happy chance that he, not
Will, was interpreting for the Admiral at the moment.
Not that Will would have rendered his impertinence to the
Admiral, but that he would have felt it incumbent upon
himself to force the stout, ill-conditioned Prince to swallow
an insult direct, or fight.</p>

<p>But Master Will was more profitably engaged. The
Prince of Favara, as is so honourably often the case with
Sicilian nobles, was a great amateur in the antiquities of his
country, and the ruins lately laid bare at Forum Pompeji
and Herculaneum were of special interest to him, for he
had, among the beggarly remnants of a patrimony which
had come down to him, a hill some ten miles from Palermo
and two from the court suburb of Bagheria, a bluff
barren hill which had been the site of the ancient city of
Soluntum founded by the Ph&oelig;nicians, where the men who
tended the vines and olives were for ever turning up some
fragment of ancient-world temples or dwellings. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
too poor to have the hill excavated as he desired; indeed,
the very vineyards and olive-gardens were leased to a
creditor, strictly bound down to do no digging above what
was necessary for trenching the trees. The Prince had
dreams of laying bare a Sicilian Pompeji when he should
have made his fortune, which he was not like to do except
by marriage with an heiress, a commodity not too plentiful
at the Neapolitan Court. But he was not a Royal favourite,
though attached to the Court; and further, any money
which Ferdinand I. of the Two Sicilies bestowed upon his
favourites was expected to be duly wasted in riotous living.</p>

<p>Well, the Prince of Favara was for showing the city
as it should be shown to his late enemy, Will; and his
sister&mdash;who had come under his protection&mdash;was as attached
to their buried city on the hill, and therefore to buried
cities generally, as himself; and I was, as ever, with Will.
And looking up to Will as I did, it seemed his plain
right that he should walk with the beautiful Donna Rusidda
and I with the Prince, lagging bravely. I had, moreover,
I think I may say without vanity, more book-brains than
Will, who was a man of action and perhaps a little narrow&mdash;which
the Prince was not long in learning. For Will was
not of the kind who can simulate by a fire of small questions
interest in a matter which does not come into his thoughts.
So the Prince had perforce to address all his information
to me. He had, since we were away fighting at the Nile,
picked up a very little English from My Lady, who had
been interested in him on account of the story of his <i>duello</i>.
But it was so little that his entire attention was necessary
for explaining the smallest point to me. But the exercise
gave him much pleasure. Unlike the Englishman, the
Italian loves to adventure in a foreign language.</p>

<p>We wandered down to a fine house near the ancient
burial ground, which was, according to the Roman wont,
outside the city gate upon the road which led to Rome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
This the Prince told me, pointing it as an instance of the
imperial sentiment of his ancestors. &ldquo;And this dwelling,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;was the Villa of no less a personage than
Cicero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before a small but neat house a garden was laid out,
in the middle of which a pond was sunk. The empty
receptacle of water was in good preservation. The stone
borders of the compartments of the garden were likewise
plainly discernible. The statues, however, with which the
whole was decorated at the first discovery, had of course
been removed to the Queen&rsquo;s Museum at Portici. But
there were two short spans, on opposite sides of the
garden, of a covered walk which had once been carried
round it. We were commencing to look about, when the
Prince called out&mdash;&ldquo;Come and see the wine-cellar: &rsquo;tis the
best in the city!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks&mdash;not for me,&rdquo; said Will. I do not know
whether he pictured to himself long rows of <i>amphor&aelig;</i>&mdash;I
think that&rsquo;s the name&mdash;of Falernian or Chian or whatever
it was called, we used to learn about in Horace&mdash;ready to
our choice and only awaiting the breaking of a seal. I
myself could have endured any wine that was not rank
vinegar; for October mornings in Naples are warmer
than our English summer, and we had had a long dusty
drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am afraid that I have nothing to offer you but
the sight of a number of fine jars,&rdquo; said the Prince, putting
aside Will&rsquo;s refusal. &ldquo;I will not call them empty, for they
do contain a residuary crust&mdash;the coke of a burnt resinous
substance. The people of this city were for the most part
Greeks, and the Greeks, as you know, still resin their
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, I was but a boy then, and I was all for having a
piece of this petrified wine lees to keep in my sea-chest as
what the Italians call a <i>curio</i>, and I hung behind the Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
for that purpose. But he had eyes, like the Queen&rsquo;s picture
of Argus, in the back of his head, so I was compelled to
take him into my confidence. At first he was very severe,
and talked of Vandals and the Queen&rsquo;s orders; but I said,&mdash;&ldquo;A
loose piece, a very little loose piece: surely that
would not matter.&rdquo; He gave a good-natured laugh, as if to
say, &ldquo;You are only a boy,&rdquo; and stooped to bury his arm
in one of the great jars, almost the shape of an egg (just
such, save for the lid, as those you may see as signs of the
sellers of sugars and spices in London). But as his hand
was about to touch the crust there was a sudden hollow
rolling resembling that of thunder. It seemed to roll round
and round the curved ceiling of the dismal vault in which
we stood in almost total darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Il monte! il monte!</i>&rdquo; cried poor Donna Rusidda, in a
paroxysm of fright, and fled incontinently, closely followed
by Will. But the Prince stopped to secure me my <i>curio</i>,
quoting, with a gaiety that had a ring of forcedness to me,
the Neapolitan proverb, <i>Heaven has its eye upon us still</i>,
which they use when some circumstance unforeseen prevents
the completion of an evil deed. But if he was scared for
the second, he recovered himself forthwith, for it was the
tradition of his house to fly in the face of fortune and fate
and omens, and all that sort of seaman&rsquo;s gospel. And I am
sure I liked the prospect a good deal less than he did.
For both he and his sister and his uncle were accustomed
to consider the approaching extinction of their house&mdash;it
was almost their religion; but I, although it was part
of my profession to be killed, had only signed the contract
to die for my country, and expected to die with at least
plenty of sea and sky room; and that awful sound began to
operate upon my nerves. I must own that the unfortunate
catastrophe of the poor Pompejans presented itself in most
horrid colours before my mind&rsquo;s eye. I expected an
instantaneous eruption of the <i>volcano</i>&mdash;as they call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
it&mdash;Pompeji overwhelmed a second time and me with it; to
be excavated perhaps some thousand years hence, and by
an excusable anachronism to be taken for a Roman skeleton,
and hung up and handled by every curious Miss in the
museum of one of our descendants. But as the Prince was
determined to grope until he found me my <i>specimen</i>, a loose
piece which he could take without the qualms of conscience,
I could not as a British officer&mdash;though I was but a mid&mdash;display
any desire for haste before a mere Italian. And
this though a terrific rattle on the vaulted roof told me that
the new eruption had begun and we were right under the
deadly shower of ashes.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity, but was, likely, less than
a minute, he found a fragment that satisfied him, and we
made our way out, where I may swear that my spirits rose
more speedily than his, for my shower of ashes was only
rain of the cataract kind which comes down in the tropics,
mingled with hail, to which our battle of the Nile seemed
child&rsquo;s play; and it was no eruption at all, but that splitting,
not very loud thunder, which will accompany a storm of
lightning right overhead, almost without intermission, and
which is even more terrifying than the loudest disconnected
claps. But he saw that which was to a Sicilian of a more
disturbing nature than bullet-stones of hail&mdash;his sister
under one of the spans of covered walk alone with Will.
It was true that they were in full view of us; but no
Sicilian woman is ever allowed to stand out of earshot with
a man who is not her brother or father, and in this instance
there was the aggravating circumstance of that mock wooing.
But it was as much as one&rsquo;s life was worth to venture out
into that hail, even across so small a matter as a Pompejan
garden court; and in the Queen&rsquo;s circle at Naples the freer
English habits had crept in much, owing to the familiarity
of the Queen with the English who came there, and notably
Sir William and My Lady. And therefore, with an Italian&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
humour, he made a jest of necessity. He had on a fine
court dress, orange and purple silk. &ldquo;It is my holiday
suit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and beggars cannot be wastrels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince needed all the comforts of philosophy, for the
thunder and lightning were awful. You expected the
mountain itself to have been swallowed up as well as its
disgorged city of Pompeji; and each time that the storm was
at its worst, Donna Rusidda would clutch hold of Will and
cling to him convulsively. I looked on my neighbour&rsquo;s face
for a fury to which the storm would be as nothing; but he
said: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis her way&mdash;I would I were by her. She needs
to be held; I have fears for her mind in a storm like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think most officers in our fleet would have held her in
Will&rsquo;s place, brother or no brother; but Will would do no
more than take her hands in his and endeavour by strong
pressure to inspire her with some of his own invincible
composure, which presently she began to feel. Her brother,
with Italian quickness of perception, grasped the significance
of Will&rsquo;s action.</p>

<p>I, looking at the two of them, imagined that the girl, with
her lovely eloquent face blanched with fear, and showing
a whole range of feelings from terror to gratitude, with her
figure now shrinking, now clinging to that splendid image
of intrepid youth, must be silently pouring out her heart to
him; while all I could gather from Will&rsquo;s attitude was that
he was striving to do his duty under circumstances the most
difficult and delicate, and that he was for changing places
with either of us.</p>

<p>The storm lasted long&mdash;I cannot say how long; but it
had not been over more than a very few minutes when
the tension on our minds was broken in an unexpected
way; and, mind you, there was tension, for during that
storm his late adversary had conceived for Will a warmth
of friendship to which for the time even mine could offer
no parallel. Will seemed to the Prince the most splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
gentleman he had ever seen, and wild thoughts were
surging through the Italian&rsquo;s brain at the idea of the old
tree of the Favara, which had seemed to have borne its
last fruit, being brought back to its ancient strength by
having this superb Northern stock grafted on to it. The
Prince was registering a vow that Will should marry
his sister&mdash;not by compulsion at the sword&rsquo;s point, as he
had once thought, but as the crown of friendship; not
in fulfilment of the ancient prophecy which predicted the
end of their house, but in final justification of the courage
with which they had always defied Fate.</p>

<p>Only some such dream could account for the extraordinary
behaviour of the Prince when the thunder and lightning
and hail had ceased, and were succeeded by a cataract of
rain; unless it were that the Sicilians, with those strange
marriage customs of theirs, considered that a man and a
woman who had once been plighted to each other, even in
a one-sided troth, of whose existence one of the parties was
ignorant, were absolved from the almost monastic restrictions
placed between unmarried people of opposite sexes.</p>

<p>What passed between them I have had more than once
from Will over our Madeira in his mansion-house at Eastry,
when he had for years been married to Katherine. It may
have gained a little in the telling, but Will was not like
most men&mdash;he was too proud to embellish, to himself or
others&mdash;and I must confess that what he told me afterwards
tallied with what I gathered from their mien.</p>

<p>For when physical fear departed with the thunder it is
certain&mdash;as certain as I could make through rain so heavy&mdash;that
Donna Rusidda began to regard Will more after the
manner of the daughters of Eve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signor Hardres,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;it is strange that I should
be prisoned here with you, who have offered me the gravest
insult which any man can offer a Sicilian woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
&ldquo;I took your word as a gentleman, by the code of your
own country, that you were ignorant how you were insulting
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man shall ever make me break my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that,&rdquo; she replied, with a charming expression
on her face which he did not then understand, but which
in reality marked the struggle between a pure high soul
and an impulse inherited from generations of ancestresses
for whom intrigue was the one interest open to a woman.
Men had their wars, their politics, their painting, many
things&mdash;and woman nothing; though there was once upon
a time a Sicilian poetess. But then what is poetry but the
breath of intrigue?</p>

<p>She had something on her mind which she could best
gain through Will, and being only a woman, and a woman
of the South at that, she was well content to make him
burn his fingers for the slight he had put upon her, no
matter how unwitting he had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why did you come under my
window?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a young fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But that does not explain everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted an escapade. I am no better than other
sailors. But their usual escapades of horseplay are not to
my taste&mdash;I prefer fighting to that. Indeed, I did fight a
few times as the alternative, till they grew tired of such
serious jests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted; but why was I honoured with supplying the
victim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were the only unmarried lady with whom I had
had the honour of conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But if you meant nothing by your serenading,
any window would have done&mdash;some window in one of
the palaces over the Marina, for instance. You were not,
I think, staying at an inn, but on your ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Mont&rsquo; alti Palace is far from the landing steps
and not above-easy to find for a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was of course speaking in Italian to her, so that the
appropriate play on his own name did not appear, nor had
she sufficient English to understand it if he had given the
proverb in English; but the truth of it struck home to me
when he put it into English for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, signor,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but why should there
have been the will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? Can young English officers leave
their ship at all times without question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would then have had serious trouble had you been
discovered by your captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not rowed ashore, I suppose, in that fine
barge with the guard of honour assigned to you, as when
you came to threaten our poor old Governor in the name
of His Britannic Majesty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I was not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor even in the very smallest of the ship&rsquo;s boats&mdash;officially?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a watch is kept on English ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that you could not take a speaking horn and halloa
for a <i>barca</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You took, then, the trouble to prearrange that a <i>barca</i>
should come alongside of your ship at such a time; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
not necessary that the watch should know this, for a
<i>barca</i> man can move in silence when directed, and on such
an occasion would not use lights. The spot where he should
lie under the ship therefore would have been indicated
with some care, and most secret signals concerted. Also
there was a guard at the landing stage even at Syracuse,
when your great fleet seemed like to blow us out of
memory; also there was the sentry to be bribed at the
town gates, or a rope ladder to be at a certain place for
scaling the walls; also without a trusty guide you would
have searched all night for the Mont&rsquo; alti Palace, which you
had never seen; also the lute which you played was
native Sicilian, and like to be especially procured for the
purpose. If your Admiral had meant to take the city by
a night surprise, he could not have laid his plans more
carefully; and you did all this without any definite object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, if you must have it, I thought you very pretty
and proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More desirable than some ladies in Syracuse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More desirable than any lady in Syracuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the same time, a woman upon whom you could
play a scurvy jest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pure jest, without any <i>arri&egrave;re pensee</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you thought a high-born lady was the proper food
for such a jest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, I do not think so. I behaved like a young
blackguard, and I am utterly ashamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you fought like a young lion to atone for it.&rdquo;
Then, as if she had said too much, or used too soft a tone,
she added quickly: &ldquo;But how is a woman going to forgive
you, when you thought it a mere jest to woo her, and were
so deadly serious about not marrying her that you were
ready to die for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; gasped the bewildered Will. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you
can tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, I.... Well, a woman is always flattered by a
man being willing to die for her, even if he is only dying
to be rid of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deserve your sarcasm; but I had your good will the
night the Admiral came to the Mont&rsquo; alti Palace, or I might
not be here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman can forgive anything to a brave&mdash;boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say cub, madam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; she said, with a pretty toss of her head,
which I noted. &ldquo;You began like a Neapolitan, but you
ended like a hero. And it would have been a very sorry
affair to have had blood, or death, or anything unforgetable
marring so fair a performance; and there was more besides,
which I would fain not tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray you.&rdquo; (This was the time at which I, Thomas
Trinder, noted what seemed a struggle between hesitancy
and archness.) &ldquo;I <em>pray</em> you,&rdquo; reiterated Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I tell you?&rdquo; she asked, in the prettiest confusion.</p>

<p>A look of mastery passed over Will&rsquo;s face. There was
no smile of triumph, as there might have been on most
young officers&rsquo; faces at such a moment; but he showed
sufficient to the quick eye of a fencing woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I knew, just ere it was too late, that I did not
love you, and nothing would have induced me to marry
you, and nothing would induce me now,&rdquo; she added, looking
maddeningly lovely, and with a certain softness on her face
which might or might not be taken to modify her words.</p>

<p>Will gathered a little hope from this look; for, strange to
say, this cartel of defiance and renunciation obliterated the
image of Katherine, and made him determine, with all the
calm resolution and fierce temper in his nature, that marry
her he would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But though I cannot, and never would, and could not
bring myself to marry you, I desire you to be my dearest
friend, as Englishmen can be the friends of women. True,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
in Sicily there can be no friendship between men and
women, because our men are what they are. Therefore a
man is never suffered to be alone with a woman until he is
irrevocably pledged to marry her&mdash;a pledge that can only
be revoked by death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you marry such men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is our fate. Besides, what is marriage but a
licence between a man and a woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But after marriage it is like England: you have no
restrictions between the friendships of men and women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no restrictions as to friendship; but it is not
like England, if what the English, who are at the Court&mdash;and
there are many&mdash;say is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delicacy prompted Will not to question her, and there
was a little silence, during which she tried to lift the
mosaics out of the broken pattern under their feet with
the point of her dainty shoe. Then she looked up and said,
&ldquo;Those friendships are not friendships&mdash;they are love
affairs. But I wish our friendship to be like your English
friendships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will bit his lip, and there was another silence, during
which the white horse in the chariot underneath them lost
the little black cube which had been his eye for twenty
centuries. Seemingly satisfied with her success in this
direction, she reiterated, &ldquo;You will give me your friendship,
Signor Vill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her his hand.</p>

<p>At that moment we heard My Lady&rsquo;s voice&mdash;&ldquo;There they
are, Cesare: give them their donkeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had, it appeared, occurred to her fertile mind that
the Court of Naples should ride round the excavations on
the fine asses which they breed in this part of Italy. The
Admiral wished to see everything&mdash;no light task in the
heat of a Neapolitan October day; and driving was an
impossibility in the narrow streets, even if the chariot ruts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
a couple of inches deep in the lava paving of the roads,
had been the proper space apart for the wheels of the
<i>calesses</i> in which we had come from Naples. What then
but ride on asses? The Court would take it as a jest, and
the Admiral should see all he desired.</p>

<p>The idea, like so many of My Lady&rsquo;s ideas, proved to be
an inspiration. The managing&mdash;the difficulty of managing&mdash;the
strange asses hastily impressed, entertained the
empty heads to whom the very antiquities were interesting
seen in this lazy manner, and afforded pleasant food for
jest. To those who were minded to see, everything Pompejan
presented itself now with an added interest. For once the
impluvia&mdash;the shallow marble ponds set in the centre of
the sloping courts&mdash;had their complement of water, and all
the ingenious devices for conveying the coveted moisture
from every surface of the house to the pond in the centre,
were at work.</p>

<p>We clattered a little along a street, when we heard My
Lady&rsquo;s clear full voice call out to stop, and those who would
to dismount. The Admiral, for all his one arm, was off his
ass before any one else, and helping My Lady to dismount,
and enter a house of a better kind, which by the traces of
mould still left could not have been so long unearthed.</p>

<p>The statues of little Amoretti were still on a little marble
island in the centre of the pool, and there were a pair of
marble shafts with the heads and shoulders of satyrs
standing in the court. My Lady hurried us into a sequence
of small chambers, no larger than the chambers made in
the thickness of the walls of ancient English castles, which
were painted in bright colours with borders of flowers, and
had groups of animals masking as human beings for their
centres. A grasshopper driving a kind of buggy with a
parrot for his steed was very quaint: I had not thought that
the Romans knew of parrots.</p>

<p>When My Lady had called Pepino to throw a bucket of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
water over the designs and freshen them up, their brilliance
was startling. Nor were they true frescoes, as we
now know the art in England, for I rubbed my finger
against them whilst they were wet, but could get no stain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon be able to see them better,&rdquo; said the
Queen&mdash;who went round the excavations with the eye of
a purchaser, who had had a residue thrown in&mdash;&ldquo;for I am
going to have those pictures of the ancients sawn off the
walls and carried to my palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were better here,&rdquo; said the Admiral boldly, when
My Lady interpreted.</p>

<p>She repeated his remark to Her Majesty, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! A few storms such as we have had to-day,
and a summer or two of the sandy breath of the sirocco,
and where would they be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then occurred a lively little dialogue, interpreted, with
improvements, no doubt, by her Ladyship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were in England I make bold to think that we
should roof them in with glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You English are made of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nation need not be made of money to have this
whole city roofed in with glass, as it is given back to the
daylight; and these would be the finest museums in the
world. The Romans were the chief race worth considering
in the ancient world, and here we have the actual houses
in which they lived, with the ashes still in the braziers and
the bread in the bins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we must give you Pompeji as your dowry when
the King has that patent of nobility drawn out which he
wishes to have the honour of conferring upon you; and then
you can put it all under one hall roof, Admiral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too good, Your Majesty, but I should feel like
a fish out of water with an estate on a continent. I am an
islander, and islands are in the keeping of fleets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are running away, Admiral, for the first time,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
the Queen, laughing good-naturedly; &ldquo;but if you won&rsquo;t
take the city, the city must come to Portici. One cannot
make these expeditions out here every day&mdash;why, it has
been at the peril of our lives,&rdquo; she added, suddenly remembering
the hail&mdash;&ldquo;but in the palace one can be
surrounded all day long with these oldest paintings in the
world. And sawing them off does not hurt them: why,
the ancients did it themselves! When Herculaneum was
dug out we found in one chamber the pictures ready sawn
off for a removal. It was put off by the eruption for a
couple of thousand years, but we carried out the wishes
of the former owners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Your Majesty!&rdquo; said the Admiral.</p>

<p>And this is how we cavalcaded round Pompeji. Nor
did we confine ourselves to the streets: we rode into the
temples, up to the very altars; and in one of them&mdash;the
temple, I think, of some Egyptian god&mdash;speaking through the
interpretation of My Lady, the Director called the Admiral&rsquo;s
attention to a secret passage perforated in two places,
observing that it was in that passage, and through its
openings, that the concealed priests of the goddess were
wont to pronounce the oracles to be delivered to a credulous
multitude. He was going to add to this valuable piece of
information other particulars, perhaps equally interesting,
when the Prince Caracciolo stopped his progress sourly by
telling him he need be at no further trouble, since he was
sure that the milord Inglese would not believe one word
of the story: the gentleman was too great an admirer of
antiquity to be persuaded that his friends, the ancients,
would be capable of upholding fraud in their worship. &ldquo;I,
for my part,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;am convinced that all the oracles
we read of in history were contrived by similar tricks of
imposition.&rdquo; And then this strange man, who in his own
religion was profoundly superstitious, changed of a sudden,
and would have us believe that these oracles were by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
direct inspiration of Satan, the arch-fiend of mankind, who,
before the establishment of the Catholic faith, was absolute
lord and master of the human race.</p>

<p>Once again the Prince&rsquo;s conversation had to be left
uninterpreted to the Admiral. This was a warning to My
Lady, who, with the adroitness for which she was famous,
immediately contrived to fill the Queen with a fresh desire,
which was that the Court should sup at a well-known
wayside house, a mere <i>trattoria</i>, which there was at Resina,
on the way back to Naples. So back the donkeys clattered
along the rutted lava street to the courtyard outside which
we had left our <i>calesses</i>.</p>

<p>On the road to Resina they were not all blessings which
the party in their hearts showered upon My Lady. The
courtiers were tired of their <i>al fresco</i> day, and wishful to be
back and banqueting in Naples in the least possible time;
for they had had their breakfast, which corresponds to our
midday meal in England, portentously early, and though
they eat but two regular meals a day, the Neapolitans, who
were accustomed to being in attendance on the Queen and
My Lady, were for the most part <i>gourmands</i>, who looked
to making up at their dinner for what they had scamped
at their breakfast. But a little before Resina their opinions
underwent a change, for it came on a smart shower, and a
<i>caless</i> gives but little shelter. There had, moreover, been
not the slightest sign of rain when we left Naples. The
ladies were for the most part provided with cloaks. The
Italian lady is both precious of her clothes and fond of
wrapping, though indifferent to the most icy draughts.
But some of the men were ill provided, notably the Prince
Caracciolo, who was just two in front of us, and in spite of
his reputed wealth, of a frugal turn.</p>

<p>Hastily stopping his <i>caless</i>, and handing the reins to
the lady he was driving, the wife of a friend to whom he
paid much attention, he requested her to stand up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
in an incredibly brief space of time had whipped his
cocked beaver into the seat, and with the utmost sangfroid
replaced it with a bandeau formed of his handkerchief,
which unequivocally betrayed his attachment to
the narcotic comfort of Virginia dust. With a wonderful
celerity for him, his upper garment, which was of pale
blue silk, and buttoned with unbecoming tightness over
his unwieldy figure, was turned inside out, and a
pleasing contrast formed between the milky hue of the
sleeves and the purple bombazine lining of the rest of
his habit.</p>

<p>You can hardly imagine what a figure of fun he made to
us boys, who had already taken a violent dislike to the
man, with his spleen and his shifting, inscrutable eyes.
But he came out in a rather more welcome light shortly;
for when we reached the inn at Resina, and had stampeded
from the <i>calesses</i> for shelter into the huge sort of kitchen,
lighted only by the great coach doorway, which served for
the eating house as well as for the cooking place, there was
such a confusion that we had doubts of getting even a <i>cena</i>,
which, as every one knows, is a much inferior thing to a
<i>pranzo</i>. But then the dour Prince, unmindful of his
ridiculous attire, put on an air of smiling self-sufficiency,
and saying, &ldquo;<i>Lascia far a me</i>,&rdquo; went out, and presently
reappeared with the Padrone, who, with the help of his
women, had been pushing the abandoned <i>calesses</i> out
of the rain under a kind of pent-house. The Padrone,
with whom the Prince seemed to be strangely familiar,
made his appearance in the <i>neglig&eacute;</i> of a nightcap and a
calico short jacket, and having understood our present
wants, though he had no idea of the Italians of our company
being anything more than well-to-do gentry, disappeared
with the truly Neapolitan promise, &ldquo;<i>Avr&agrave; un buon pranzo
in un momento</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very short time,&rdquo; said the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
&ldquo;Indeed, you will get it in a very few minutes,&rdquo; said
Caracciolo.</p>

<p>The Queen turned on him with the haughtiness that
came so naturally to the daughter of Maria Theresa:
&ldquo;The Prince seems to know Resina better than I should
have expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty. The fact is, that there is an estate
in the neighbourhood to which I go for hunting.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_4_4">[4]</a></span>
More what we should call shooting in England.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;and do you get good
sport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, excellent, your Majesty&mdash;excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King will be glad to hear of it. He is always glad
of fresh country to hunt so near Naples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be most honoured,&rdquo; said the Prince, turning
round to scowl at the innkeeper, who had returned. We
caught the scowl, and wondered if it conveyed more than
that the Prince&rsquo;s temper was ruffled. Our patience had
been put to no great trial. The innkeeper had come to
announce the <i>buon pranzo</i>, which consisted of a tolerable
vermicelli soup, a pork fry, and a dish of delicate little fish
unfortunately fried in oil. The Italian ladies turned up
their noses at the fish: to cook in oil was the sign of a
very poor eating-house. To us boys, however, all was
manna in the desert, and Prince Caracciolo fell to with
such energy and rapacity that before I had despatched four
or five of the little transparent fish, which almost fell to
pieces, he had emptied the dish in front of him altogether.
The little creatures glided down his fauces unmasticated,
much more quickly than they move in their native element.</p>

<p>Noticing the dismay on the faces of the men in the
company, he mentioned that the supply was unlimited,
and that more would be brought in hot from the pan as
required. The Queen called for <i>lachrime Christi</i>, saying,
&ldquo;To dine at the foot of Vesuvio and not drink <i>lachrime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
Christi</i>, would be worse than being at Rome and not seeing
St. Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Vulite roba buona?</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> asked mine host, not in the least
knowing who she was, but gathering from her appearance
that she was rich enough to like his best.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a></span>
&ldquo;Would you like good stuff?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, signor</i>,&rdquo; she replied, with a little smile at the
fellow&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve ignorance. Never before had a royal party
dined more economically: including the &ldquo;capital stuff,&rdquo; the
bill did not come up to seven carlins a head&mdash;half a crown
perhaps of our money. And when the bill was brought,
or rather the amount named&mdash;for in these humble <i>trattorie</i>
they save the expense of bill-paper&mdash;she ordered an equal
amount to be added to it, with the good wishes of their
Majesties of the Two Sicilies.</p>

<p>The man was aghast, until he had a nudge from Caracciolo:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that it is Her Majesty, <i>Pasquale</i>?&rdquo;
And then we had the civility and obeisances which would
have spoiled the whole fun of the feast if our incognito had
been betrayed earlier. And My Lady, in particular, had
enjoyed herself mightily: she loved new dishes, and vowed
that she would have pork fry and those little sand-fish done
in oil at her next supper at the Embassy.</p>

<p>We did well in stopping. A heavenly evening had
succeeded the storm and shower; the latter had precipitated
every azotic impurity in the atmosphere, and imparted to
it a fresh supply of oxygen; a luxuriant vernal vegetation
exhaled its perfumes more freely&mdash;it was a treat to breathe!
A brilliant moon assisted to conduct us safely and pleasantly
through Portici to the Castel del Carmine; and, skirting
the shore past the Immacolata, we rounded the Castel
Nuovo to the Royal Palace, where we drew up in a kind
of salute while the Queen entered, and then dispersed
to our several destinations.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span>&mdash;Of the Supper
at the Palace that followed.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y Lady&rsquo;s feasting on the little fish, which had almost
rivalled the Prince Caracciolo&rsquo;s miraculous draught,
did not seem to interfere with her appetite at the
State dinner, or perhaps I should say supper, which took
place at the Queen&rsquo;s Palace in Naples as soon as the guests
could conveniently reassemble after repairing the ravages
of so hot and wet a day. She ate with her accustomed
heartiness, as I was in a position to see, for she had
me to sit next to her. Will was there officially as the
Admiral&rsquo;s interpreter&mdash;an office which later was more often
filled by My Lady herself, during the Admiral&rsquo;s long spell
ashore in the Two Sicilies. She had said to Her Majesty,
in her good-natured way, &ldquo;Let Tubby and Josiah come;
they can&rsquo;t babble away any secrets, for they will not understand
one word we say.&rdquo; She had quite forgiven Josiah
for his brutal and at that time undeserved assault on her
friendship with his step-father, and he was her devoted slave
again: indeed, there was nothing small about My Lady,&mdash;even
her vanity was too great to charge with pettiness.
I may say here that Josiah was mighty careful that night;
and I do think it was from fear of forgetting himself again,
although such a very young officer was not likely to exceed
before the company in which he found himself. For Her
Majesty had invited all the captains that could be spared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
both for the expedition to Pompeji and for the banquet;
and all around us, mingled with the beauties and most
trusted nobles of the Neapolitan Court were such men
as Troubridge and Alexander Ball, the pick of Nelson&rsquo;s
captains, men whom any other Power would have been
glad to welcome as commanders-in-chief at that moment&mdash;such
was their martial fame for the handling of their
ships, and stomach for fighting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which was the finer sight, the scene in the
ante-room under the huge rock-crystal chandeliers with
their hundreds of wax tapers, or the scene at the crescent-shaped
dining-table groaning beneath its rich services of
the precious metals, fashioned by such gold-and-silversmiths
as the Florentine, Cellini. In the former, the modest but
self-reliant carriage of the men, who had made all Europe
ring with the fame of their deeds, contrasted finely with
the noble figures and carriage of the young Italian beauties
with whom Her Majesty loved to surround herself&mdash;women
who held themselves as upright as though they had borne
on their heads the Greek water-pitchers of antique mould
which their peasant women carry to the wells. They had,
too, the strength and health on which the daughters of our
country squires pride themselves, and, yet, more grace
than ever we saw in the great French ladies when Will
and I were with the Allies at the occupation of Paris fifteen
years or more later, gone there to see the great sight, like
so many of the gentry round Dover. And just as for
carriage there are no women to be matched with these
Southern Italians, so in many cases it was with their skins,
which were exquisitely velvety and clear, and showed the
rich crimson of their blood through the transparent brown.
I noted, and I think Will noted particularly, the difference
between Donna Rusidda and them; for her skin, while just
as transparent and beautiful in texture, was more of an
olive hue, and showed the blood but rarely and at moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
of great agitation&mdash;though her cheeks then, to use the words
of the old song, were &ldquo;as ruddy as a peach&rdquo; for all their
brownness. But I thought, and I could swear that Will
thought, that this very circumstance conferred upon her
visage a kind of distinction.</p>

<p>Most of the ladies could by now speak a little, a very
little English&mdash;a gift of tongues which was not shared by
many of the officers, much as they had served in Italian
waters. However, between them they could make words
enough to serve while they were assembling for the
banquet, and each keeping an eye on the door by which
Her Majesty was to enter.</p>

<p>At the dinner the grace of the women was not shown to
the full, nor were the attitudes of the officers so characteristic;
but to make up for this came the rolls of hearty laughter.
For the Queen on these occasions by no means maintained
a royal reserve, for all the haughtiness in her nature.
Maria Carolina loved fine men, and loved above all things
to see them <em>themselves</em>, and I judge that she was not averse
<em>to seeing them themselves</em> for the further reason that it enabled
her to gauge their value as instruments.</p>

<p>Those who had known him long, like Captain Troubridge,
could not help noting, even now, the change that was
coming over the Admiral. Formerly he was extremely
reserved when dining in the presence of ladies, saying but
little and drinking no wine until the King&rsquo;s health should
be proposed, and always drinking such healths in bumpers.
Now he took a little wine during dinner, not wishing, I
think, to appear peculiar; and talked very much to My Lady,
although he was sitting between her and the Queen. It
was, as I have writ, My Lady&rsquo;s whim that I should sit upon
her other hand that night, and so I had good opportunity
for observing. Will sat on the other side of Captain
Troubridge to interpret between him and Her Majesty, while
My Lady interpreted for the Admiral. She spoke Italian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
and also the Neapolitan dialect, like English; though she
could not write her native tongue better than a clever
child.</p>

<p>Having so often heard the tradition of his taciturnity
at the table, I own I was most astonished at his flow
of table talk; for, though he paid My Lady compliments not
a few, they were no more than any other officer in his
fleet would have paid&mdash;certainly no more than such men
as Captain Troubridge and Captain Hallowell, who had not
his flow of other conversation.</p>

<p>That the Admiral could express himself well, any one
who has read his letters published from time to time could
not fail to see. He was no maker of epigrams, but he
said things so briefly, and so to the point, that one could
remember them like epigrams; and, for a seaman, he had
a remarkably well-stored mind. A full knowledge of
history he considered essential to every commander who
would understand his business; and I think that during
those years on shore before the battle of St. Vincent, when
he was living a sort of farmer&rsquo;s life in his father&rsquo;s parsonage,
he must have had the run of a fairly-stocked library and
mastered its contents, as it was his wont to master anything
he put his mind to. He was likely talking his best, for
was he not next to one of the world&rsquo;s most famous beauties
in the first days of the friendship to which she had shown
herself so well disposed? What I overheard of their
conversation I cannot, as one of the Admiral&rsquo;s officers, bring
myself to write; not that there was anything that I should
blush to repeat on paper, but indeed I could rather write
down a man&rsquo;s coarseness than his tenderness, for his
tenderness is sacred to the person to whom it is addressed,
and his coarseness is mere anathema. But I think I may
say something of their appearance, which any one at the
table, and servants, could see as well as I. The Admiral
had on his battle look. As is well known, when battle was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
imminent, until the moment for deeds came, after making
his dispositions, he would retire and write his last letters
and his last wishes, and think of those he loved best, and
pray for his country and them. He prayed till the last
moment before his actual service as a commander was
required; and in after years, when My Lady was wife to him
in all but name, the lack of a conventional marriage-tie
between them did not prevent that great heart from
mingling the woman he loved best with the last prayers
which ascended to his Creator. But when the moment
came for the round shot to be tearing the decks, and sowing
death, the Admiral would be on his quarter-deck all alert,
but smiling like a boy playing a game in which he is the
best player.</p>

<p>It was that light-hearted boy&rsquo;s look he wore while he sat
by My Lady that first night on which I saw them much
together.</p>

<p>And as for her, she had just that gracious look of the
woman, who has been the unconquered Amazon all her life,
when she has found the man for whom she will surrender.
Not that My Lady had ever been the unconquered Amazon,
but she had every womanly graciousness in her repertoire,
and could use them with a generousness, which made
them genuine, as the occasion demanded. And this was
the finest and best of them. That My Lady was capable
of a passionate devotion had been shown by her fidelity to
Mr. Greville. The Admiral was exactly qualified to take
her whole heart. To her imagination, her pride in her
country, her pride of vanity, he appealed more highly than
was possible for any other man living, and to her generous
affectionate woman&rsquo;s heart, which must have been bruised
by Mr. Greville&rsquo;s desertion and weary of Sir William&rsquo;s
weakness, his chivalrousness, and the affectionate <i>esprit de
corps</i> which made every man who ever served with him
his slave, came as a balm and a cordial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
These two were all in all to each other that night. The
Admiral, as I have said, alert and smiling, was rarely
brilliant for him; My Lady, with beautiful eager face, and
every now and then a sort of happy sob heaving in that
exquisite white bosom, was hanging on his words.</p>

<p>Though I said they were all in all, the Admiral had
perforce to address himself to Her Majesty sufficiently, and
from time to time to call out some toast or make some rally
to his captains.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, who was only a boy then, that Her
Majesty was of a purpose devoting her whole attention to
Captain Troubridge, to whom she had given the second
place of honour on her left hand&mdash;he being the most distinguished
of the captains present. I did not think then
all I am about to say, for I knew less of life, and I had not
the light of what has happened since to guide me; but,
testing the proceedings with these acids, I should say that
the daughter of Maria Theresa was desirous on the one
hand of giving Lady Hamilton full play in subjugating the
Admiral, and that on the other hand she was desirous of
bringing all the influences of her beauty, her womanly charm,
her splendid birth, and her queenhood, to bear upon the
bluff British sailor, who was of all the least amenable to
women&rsquo;s wiles, and who was in the future always to be
in the balance against the influence of herself and Lady
Hamilton with the Admiral. Speaking from memory and
experience, I picture Captain Troubridge as a little uneasy
in this bower of Armida. But there was one thing which
made him to some extent the willing servant to the Queen
of Naples,&mdash;Captain Troubridge was a fighting man, and he
had the highest admiration for the courage, resourcefulness
and patriotism of the woman who, married to a <i>roi fain&eacute;ant</i>,
made such a good fight to maintain her kingdom&rsquo;s place
among the nations.</p>

<p>As for myself, the dinner was rather mortifying, for My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
Lady, after placing me next to her, forgot my existence,
until a lackey, breaking a crystal goblet on her right hand
between her and me, in the attempt to fill it without disturbing
her colloquy with the Admiral, made a portentous
crash which attracted the attention of the whole company,
including even My Lady; who, suddenly becoming aware
of my existence, and feeling that she had treated me rather
badly, put her arm round me and kissed me, with everybody
looking. The blood rushed to my head until I must have
looked like the merchant ensign; and, to add to my confusion,
the lady on the other side, who was the wife of an
Italian prince and could not speak a word of English, seized
the cue, and almost took me on her knee in her attempt to
make up for her deficiency as a linguist.</p>

<p>At last that terrible banquet ended, and the company
scattered about the reception-rooms and the terrace overlooking
the sea. The Admiral and My Lady went out on
the terrace. Her Majesty remained in the great room,
which she had recently had decorated with frescoes in the
style discovered in the excavations at Pompeji. She made
rather an ostentation of talking to Neapolitans, and principally
to the ladies among them; the subject of their conversation,
from their looks, being the manly beauty of the
English officers gathered under the centre chandelier&mdash;a
splendid group. In true English style the captains stood
together talking&mdash;no doubt of Service matters, just as they
would when they met almost daily on the flagship or in the
Admiral&rsquo;s anterooms at My Lady&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>Will, his services not being required by the Admiral,
was standing a little way from them. He was English, and
therefore wished to do what the English did, and yet had
too much pride and too good manners to go nearer to
his superior officers; and I humbly took up my position
by him, not expecting him to talk to me upon such an
occasion, but from sheer not knowing what else to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
In a very few minutes My Lady and the Admiral returned,
My Lady leading the way straight up to the captains. She
had by this become so intimate with Her Majesty that there
was no need for her to observe Court etiquette on entering
the presence of the Sovereign. With the captains she was
so natural and unaffected that even Captain Troubridge was
melted.</p>

<p>Hardly had she taken up her position when Donna
Rusidda, having spoken with Her Majesty, upon whom
she was attending, and having made her courtesy with
the grace of a Neapolitan girl and a daughter of generations
of courtiers, glided across the room to bring, as it
seemed, a message to her Ladyship, though she lingered
afterwards. I cannot say whether My Lady had an instinct
against her. She was all smiles, as was her wont at such
a gathering. But she did not lay her hand on the girl to
detain her, or improvise any of the excuses for which she
had such a happy invention; and after a few minutes of
awkwardness Donna Rusidda was departing, a little crest-fallen,
when her eye fell upon Will, almost in her path, just
off the edge of the group. She motioned him to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Signor Vill,&rdquo; she said in her own language, her
face lighting up with a smile even more beautiful than My
Lady&rsquo;s, for it was rarer: &ldquo;why do not all your English
officers speak Italian, as you do? They spend their lives
in guarding the coasts of our country, and yet do not
understand any of her children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will was quite gallant in his reply: I know what he
said. I think we must have discussed every incident of
our life in the Two Sicilies during the long years in which
we have been neighbours and brothers-in-law on the bleak
coast of Kent. He said, &ldquo;Because they have no charming
lady to take them in hand. I had a beautiful young
mother, who was brought up in Mediterranean ports, and
has never ceased to pine for the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
What a devoted woman Donna Rusidda was we were
to know only too well afterwards; but she was not above
a woman&rsquo;s curiosity or caprice, and, the Admiral being as
usual the feature of the evening, it was not long before
she had man&oelig;uvred to get the weather side of Will,
where, while she was talking to him, she could see the
Admiral, and where the great man&rsquo;s eye might occasionally
light on her.</p>

<p>She answered his polite little speech with a charming
smile, but said nothing. So he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must try harder to learn my language too.
You must not say Signor Vill, but Signor Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; not Vill, but Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes: Ou-ill&mdash;Signor Ou-ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not Signor Ou-ill, but Signor Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signor W-W-Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it: Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Signor W-Will,&rdquo; she said coquettishly&mdash;&ldquo;I have
to prepare my mouth for it, or I cannot say it&mdash;I cannot
stay with you. I have given my message, and must go
back to Her Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Donna Rusidda!&rdquo; he began reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what, Signor W-Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not waiting for some answer from My Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Have you a message which you wish the
Signora Hamilton to give to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None that I would not rather give myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot take messages from a midshipman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a midshipman,&rdquo; he said, with injured dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have risen very quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was always a lieutenant, from the very first time you
saw me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were never a lieutenant when you inflicted that
insult on me: that was a midshipman&rsquo;s trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
&ldquo;Will you never forget or forgive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have forgiven it, or how would the affair have ended?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed you did, Signorina,&rdquo; said Will, with warm
gratitude in his voice. &ldquo;Will you forget it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I can promise that; but I have
offered you my friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the same thing,&rdquo; he said, giving her such a look
as I should not have thought any woman could resist. In
all that assemblage there was no one with high breeding
and high courage writ so plainly on his face; and he
was so young, so beautiful, so fair in colouring. Even
his eyes, his proud blue eyes, had for once lost their
hardness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not the same thing; I do not want to forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am not completely forgiven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you are, Signor W-Will. You are already
almost my best friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is <em>the</em> fortunate person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that I have a brother and an uncle,&rdquo; she
said, with a touch of dignity.</p>

<p>Will was relieved a little, and his relief was completed
when she broke into a sweet soft smile, which he poetically
compared to me (after his second glass of Madeira) to the
moon on the Bay of Naples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Donna Rusidda, what are to be the privileges
of friendship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a concern which was to me
more engaging than her archness. &ldquo;Oh, Signor W-Will,
you are not speaking as an Italian would speak, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather die,&rdquo; he replied, with a respectfulness
which must have gone straight to her heart, for she was so
grateful, so frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the right of coming to me and speaking to me
as you would to an English girl; of staying by me if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
are left, instead of instantly quitting; of walking with me
as you would with an English girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will speak to my brother. Besides, having once
accepted you as my lover&mdash;even the Sicilian custom would
give me the right. There is no jilting by men in Sicily, so
that is not provided for in our customs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; said Will, &ldquo;there is nothing in all the Two
Sicilies I value like this permission of yours. But I am
strangely sensitive about codes, and your brother and I
have fought&mdash;and he has generously taken me back into
his friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gave him his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true; but that only wiped out the debt I had
already incurred. All that he has done since is a free gift,
which leaves me much again in his debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you wish me to do, then?&rdquo; she asked almost
petulantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish your brother to repeat your offer to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made a charming figure as she stepped lightly and
quickly across the dark polished floor, gleaming with the
reflection of the countless wax-lights, to where, at the far
end of the room from the Queen and her ladies, her
brother was talking to a group of noblemen and State
functionaries. The light shining above and the dark shining
below made just the right foils for the soft white satin of
the gown that hung in graceful folds from her shoulders,
which, like her small well-shaped head, were thrown slightly
back. She went up to her brother with a look which
bespoke sisterly confidence and affection, mingled with
respect for the head of the house, but quite unembarrassed.
And she had not spoken with him above a minute or two
when they came to where Will was standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall leave you to Ruggiero,&rdquo; she said, preparing to
trip away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, please don&rsquo;t leave us.
We are not quarrelling, are we, your Highness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly quarrelling,&rdquo; replied the Prince: &ldquo;I have come
to repeat what my sister said. As you have been engaged,
our Sicilian customs permit of it, and I would trust your
honour before my own. You are already my friend, and
you can be my sister&rsquo;s friend, as you would be the friend
of an Englishwoman. She has told me what you both
take that to mean, and, if any one chooses to misinterpret
it, I have a sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will was explaining, with genuine feeling, his sense of
the honour thus paid him, when the Admiral spied the
Prince and his sister in their friendly colloquy with him,
and stepped forward to speak to the former. It fired the
Admiral&rsquo;s generous soul to see the handsome terms upon
which the combatants of the duel he had frustrated were
with each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you and the Princess
do me the honour of taking breakfast on the flagship, when
I return from Caserta, and meeting the General? A small
affair&mdash;not a reception of Her Majesty by the British
Admiral. My Lady here will receive the ladies; we have
a raree to show you&mdash;the little bird which flew on board
just before my late battle, stayed with us all through the
action, and is now free of my cabin. She eats in the
prettiest way from my table, and is, I take it, the most
potent and companionable familiar in the whole history of
magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince expressed his thanks with elaborate Italian
politeness and Southern warmth. It was the first time he
had spoken with the Admiral since that memorable night
in the Palazzo Mont&rsquo; alti; and being a man of high courage,
and the last of a martial Norman race, the glory of the
Admiral&rsquo;s great deeds appealed with unusual strength to
his imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
As the Prince of Favara advanced to meet the Admiral,
his sister&rsquo;s face was full of mischievous laughter. She had
in truth created rather a difficult position for herself, and
the best way out of it was to consider Will discomfited,
which in truth he was, though events jumped so well with
his wishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Signor W-Will, did I not tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I meant to tell you, and you knew I knew, and
do not look so frightened. I do not expect you to propose
marriage to me this very minute, or even to carry me off
for a midnight walk; but I am tired&mdash;yes, tired of our
desperate Sicilian custom of all the ladies standing round
that dais at one end of the room, as there, with Her Majesty
and all the gentlemen round the dais at the other end, as
there&mdash;where you see the Duke, the Prince, the three
Counts, and the Ministers. You English take the centre
of the floor. You do not have customs like we do, which
can only be cheated by intrigues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it very dreadful of you to be standing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very dreadful; but not so dreadful as it would be
if my brother, who is my only protector, were not here.
And I am going to rebel, and take English leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you were English you would go to places with
a married lady friend; and when you arrived you would
leave her, and never find her again until you wished to
escape from somebody or to go home. Perhaps the Ambassador&rsquo;s
wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;you know her story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that. All Naples knows her story, and
many married ladies in Naples have the same story about
themselves. It does not affect her position in society.
People would only laugh and think one mad if one attacked
her for that. No, it is not that: it is simply&mdash;well, I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
wish to be beholden to her. My brother has always been
my protector, and he has a sharp sword. And there is
Donna Marziani. You English know what is meant by a
<i>duenna</i>, do you not?&rdquo; she rattled on in her voluble Italian.
She and Will spoke Italian because it was as easy to him
as English, and English was so difficult to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need we stand here, then? Why should we not go
and sit on one of those stiff-backed couches with the gilt
lions&rsquo; legs which line the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us: it will be my declaration of independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she and Will moved off in their silent revolution&mdash;a
revolution almost as shocking to Sicilian ideas as the
late horrible Revolution in France&mdash;My Lady, seeing me
stranded like a fish on the rocks at low water, called to
me, &ldquo;Tubby!&rdquo; which I resented on so formal an occasion;
nor had I yet forgiven her for having kissed me at the
dinner-table, though there were plenty&mdash;the Admiral
himself, as I knew after, and was not too young then to
suspect&mdash;who would have taken a kiss from Lady Hamilton
under even more arduous conditions. Nor was I best
pleased to find that she had only called me to lay her
hand upon my shoulder in a caressing way while she
pursued her conversation with the Admiral.</p>

<p>He was saying: &ldquo;This confounded fellow cannot move
without five carriages. I have formed my opinion; I
heartily pray I may be mistaken.&rdquo; And then they went
on talking about five-and-thirty thousand of the finest troops
in the world; forty thousand levies; sending a legion of
five thousand by sea; and General Championnet and the
spread of pernicious opinions, till I should have yawned
if I had not had, as I thought, Captain Troubridge&rsquo;s eye
on me. I suppose I must have yawned, for the Queen
sent one of her ladies to fetch me. I stole a glance at
Will, but he had no eyes save for Donna Rusidda, who
was, as I thought, merely angling with him. Then I looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
at the captains, but they were far too occupied with great
matters to think of a midshipman, unless he was rampantly
misbehaving himself. I did not, somehow or other, look
at the Admiral: I felt I did not mind him; and then I
let myself be spoilt by the beautiful Court ladies&mdash;I, who
am now a plain half-pay captain, living on a very modest
income in a cottage at Walmer.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV.</span>&mdash;What the Admiral
wrote of My Lady in his
Journal.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS the less inclined to write what I heard between
the Admiral and My Lady at the banquet both because
it was a delicate matter to write upon such a subject
from memory, and the more so because in the Journal the
Admiral (if he wrote it) has committed his own meditations
to paper.</p>


<p class="centerpad"><span class="smcap">Extract from the Journal.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And so good-night! A wonderful woman! We have
been together hours&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;to-day, but
for the most part with very much company till the very end,
when we drove home from the Queen&rsquo;s party and found
Sir William retired with a touch of fever, which concerned
the dear creature very much. She would not wait one
second to pull off her wrap, but flew to him, only to find
him sufficiently recovered to have sunk into the profound
sleep which precedes health. Sir William was ailing when
we left, I do not know how early in the morning, to
see the ruins lately excavated of an ancient Roman city
buried by an eruption of the volcano about the time of
St. Paul&mdash;a circumstance to be noted, because it enables us
to judge somewhat the manner of men those Romans were,
whom the founders of our wonderful religion were called
on in a way to defy. I am inclined to think favourably of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
them. Pompeji, that was the name of the city, was a
favourite haunt of the leading Romans, who founded and
administered an empire which our own is only just now
beginning to rival in extent, its riches being out of the
question. The richest men in Pompeji were content with
houses which no farmer in England would tolerate. You
could put any house in Pompeji into the big barn at
Burnham Thorpe, and they had no marble in them except
for fountains and the like; the walls of the rooms and
the pillars of the courts both being covered with a hard
stucco, simply but elegantly painted. I could have wished
that all the relics which the Queen has so carefully
collected at her palace at Portici had been left rooted to
the spot where they had been found. I wanted to see the
brazier full of coals, which were half burnt when the
eruption came down, standing where it was when Roman
hands filled it with those coals; I wanted to see the charred
bread on the table where it was waiting to be eaten; I
wanted to see the skeleton of the sentry guarding the place
where its owner had looked death in the face. At Portici
they are only the playthings of an idle court, which might
destroy them if it thought about them. Indeed, I have
great fears for them: I must speak to Emma, who takes a
scholar&rsquo;s interest in them, and a more human intelligent
interest in them than Sir William, who of course taught
her, and is the first <i>s&ccedil;avant</i> in Italy. The Queen would,
I doubt not, give them to her if she asked for them; and if
they are not to be at Pompeji, and this country is in a
shockingly disturbed condition just now, they had better
be put on board the first of my ships that has to go home,
and be taken to the Royal Museum in London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marvellously interesting I found it, and the good Queen
had a fresh house excavated on purpose for me to see
how the things looked when they were found. It was a
fine house&mdash;one of the best in the city. The frescoes on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
the walls were equal to most which they have peeled off
and carried to Portici. There was a very handsome white
marble fountain; there were some fair statuettes and stel&aelig;
(whatever are these last for? I had the name from Emma);
but the very things I most wished to see were absent&mdash;the
ruins of a meal on a table, and skeletons in the position in
which they were overtaken in the storm. Any articles of
household furniture, which Emma says were mostly of
bronze, and therefore would not have been consumed, I
should have desired to see in the places where they were
being used when the end came. But this house might have
been the ruins of part of the Pope&rsquo;s Museum at Rome!</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I must confess that the chief interest of the
day to me was watching that wonderful woman as she
led the way through all these marvels of antiquity, her
beautiful face beaming with intelligence and consideration
for us; and she was no dry-as-dust, for, in the midst of a
disquisition, she would find time to say to me&mdash;&lsquo;Nelson, I
had this shepherdess hat out from England: tell me, am I
not too old for it?&rsquo; she all the while looking like a girl
in the freshness of her teens. All through the day she
heaped delicious favours upon unworthy me. It was only
perhaps a hand caressingly laid on my shoulder when I
was to look at something; or thrust through my arm and
let to rest on it when there was an unusually trying walk
from excavation to excavation; or a drawing in of skirts
to make room for me at her side when a party of us,
headed by Emma and the Queen, sat down to the second
breakfast with our legs in the deepest fountain we could
find. It was dry, and perhaps two feet deep; and I daresay
we cut a comical figure enough, looking as if the table and
our legs had gone through the floor and left us squatting
round a hole. It was Emma&rsquo;s idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there was a storm, which drove us for refuge into
the custode&rsquo;s quarters. Emma was sorely frighted. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
were alone, huddled up in a narrow passage. She was so
prostrated, and near fainting, that I had to strive to win her
with the gentlest caresses to prevent her from succumbing;
but when she came to, the storm beginning to abate, she was
not angry, but suffered me most graciously. Then we
had the drive to Resina. I was driving her <i>caless</i>, and
she let herself rest against me in sheer weariness after the
agitation of the afternoon, but very trustful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then came that mad supper in the tavern-kitchen, in
which Emma, revived by her resting, was a queen of the
revels again. What a scene it was! these uncouth beings
made to provide a feast, such as one sees in a buffo-comedy,
for their Queen, with Emma spurring them on to fresh
extravagances, and the Neapolitan Commodore Caracciolo,
as I judged, airing a sardonic wit which I missed, being
no Italian. And when I could not partake of the dishes of
the country, which were mightily rich with their pork and
their oil, Emma flew away from the table herself, and
catching one of her lackeys made him bring a basket from
which she gave me biscuits and fruit, of which I partook
sparingly, really that it might not be a fool&rsquo;s errand for
her. Mine host&rsquo;s wine was very fair. Emma is a splendid
creature, with superb health, about which she takes not a
thought. She ate their oily dainties with the greatest
gusto, because, as she said, their simplicity and plainness
were refreshing after the artificial feasts to which she was
bound as Ambassador&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Refreshed in this simple, plain and hearty fashion,
she was all <i>esprit</i> on the remainder of the drive into
Naples through the dusk. She was wonderfully animated;
and I had from her, in her own natural words, for my
benefit, all that she had had from the learned Sir William
about the flourishing ports and bathing places, served
mostly by Greeks, which had clustered round the vine-clad
slopes of Vesuvio before the eruption. I could almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
see their destruction, so eloquent were her gestures. And
very frequently she would break off suddenly, saying&mdash;&lsquo;But
I am wearying you&mdash;I am letting my enthusiasm
run away with me. Forgive me, Nelson,&rsquo; and this so
penitently, with a timid little touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our <i>caless</i> we drove post haste, so soon as we had
left the Queen, to Sir William&rsquo;s palace on the Chiaja. For
we had to dress for dinner with Her Majesty, and a
beautiful woman needs time for her toilet; though in this
respect Emma is so speedy that &rsquo;tis plain that she relies
on Nature first, and but little on Art. I had not got into
my state uniform above a few minutes, when I beheld her
a vision of loveliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had hoped to have Sir William with us. Common
prudence had indeed bade him forego the expedition to
Pompeji, from which, with the drenchings we had, he would
certainly have come back in a raging fever, even if he
could have borne the long hot drive in the morning and the
chance of a cold wind coming up as the hours began to throw
their shadows. The ruined city is noted for its draughtiness:
the wind comes very keenly round the mountain; and I
doubt not there is an aguishness in the newly turned soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot well describe my feelings as I sat beside her
in the Ambassador&rsquo;s coach. All day long in her shepherdess
hat, she had been half tomboy, half affectionate daughter,
always like a fresh young girl. And now, after bare leisure
to cool down as I should have thought, she was sitting by
my side in a most superb costume&mdash;the great lady all over&mdash;a
veritable queen in condescension. In the short drive
from the Embassy to the Royal Palace she was all solicitude
for me, fearing a return of the fever after the drenching of
the afternoon; but, praise God, I felt no ill result. It is
truly wonderful what effect my spirits have upon my health.
When I have the enemy within cannon-shot, or the society
of those I love, nothing mortal seems able to hurt me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have wrote &lsquo;love,&rsquo; and must confess to you, my Pen,
that it startles me when I see it in black upon the white
paper; and yet I suppose it is so. And why should I not
love? It is the purest, I am sure, of human feelings, such
love as mine: God knows I would die for Emma, as I
would die for my country. I pray that I may never be the
villain to her. There has been love, I know, perfectly pure
between a man and woman, which has yet been most
disastrous for the man, if not for his country also. But,
thank Heaven, this is not so with Emma. It has been
entirely for the advancement of our country, of which I
have been permitted to be the instrument. Without that
wonderful woman we should never have got to my battle
at all: it was she who secured us our supplies at Syracuse;
a very little malevolence might have turned the sea into
the drinking water, and sent the provisions out of reach
into the interior. And now it is she who is working
upon the innate slothfulness, I might say cowardice, and
irresponsibility of those who administer this unhappy
kingdom, to support its noble Queen in that active policy
against the French which will lead to so much glory and
send that lying and apostate race, the enemies of mankind,
packing out of the Peninsula. In after days no one shall
say that Nelson was dragged down by his friendship for
Emma, or wiled from his duty into hanging attendance, but
rather that it was she who inspired him to fresh exertions
and had no thought but for his country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this passed through my mind in that short coach-drive,
as she laid her cool hand anxiously upon my lately-heated
head, and reassured herself that there was no fever
in my pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the dinner, she was on my right hand, I on Her
Majesty&rsquo;s right hand. Her Majesty is a noble woman, a
true daughter of the great Empress. A masculine intelligence;
a man&rsquo;s courage, vigour and decision; of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
by all accounts there is much need, for the King, though
a man of great stature and bodily strength, and with plenty
of mere bravery, has no thought for the morrow, nor indeed
for his kingdom except as an institution to supply him with
plenty of wild beasts for the chase and a sufficiency of
money, which he never finds sufficient, to keep his friends,
if one may call them such, round him. He is not even
faithful to that noble woman; and she, with a fine scorn,
akin to pity, condones his infidelity in return for his
refraining from injuring his kingdom, as he would if he
interfered with her wise counsels. For Ferdinand would
treat politics as he treats his ducats&mdash;squander them for
the gratification of the unworthy whim of the moment. He
is indeed a despicable man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen has her softer moments, too; she is
beautiful, and can be very tender. The first time that we
were alone, when I looked for a grateful Queen condescending
to the Admiral who had led the allies of her country to
conquest, I found a weeping girl. I do not mean that she is
young&mdash;she is by this past forty&mdash;but at that moment she
was a girl back in her Austrian home with her unfortunate
sister, the lovely martyr Marie Antoinette, whom those
fiends insensately murdered. I could see that they were,
as it were, girls together again in their childhood&rsquo;s home.
Then, all in a moment, Marie Antoinette had been for years
Queen of France, and murdered! I knew all this, though I
could not translate the burning words which she poured
into my ear in a passion of grief that turned into a passion of
triumph&mdash;for suddenly tears and grief were swept from that
inspired face, and she hailed me avenger of the martyr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that moment she was my intimate and affectionate
friend; she would have me not treat her as a
Queen, but rather as a well-loved lady of my acquaintance
to whom I had rendered great service, and who had therefore
admitted me to the footing of a relation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
&ldquo;She has divined, I feel certain, the respect that I feel for
Emma, and my admiration for her rare graces of mind&mdash;and
I may say to you, Pen, of person&mdash;for during the banquet
she said to me, &lsquo;You look after dear Lady Hamilton: my
kingdom owes everything to her after you.&rsquo; And she
herself was most condescending to Tom Troubridge, who
stood the fire. He is the finest sailor in His Majesty&rsquo;s
Service, and not to be swayed either by royal condescension
or considerations of personal friendship, when&mdash;to give his
expression, which means more to him than any officer
engaged in the late battle&mdash;he is sounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not say exactly what our conversation tended to
at the banquet; I believe I talked better than I ever talked
before. A good listener can inspire conversation. I do not
know if an extraordinary desire to please fosters or chills it;
I found myself talking on about myself. Perhaps the
general tendency of our conversation was at first directed to
the models in history upon which I had based my strategy
and endeavoured to mould my conduct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this the conversation must have wandered to an
interchange&mdash;a recognition, almost an enumeration of signs
of sympathy between us. I never found a woman so
sympathetic, so completely the ideal of the feminine
influence which should inspire a man. In this part of the
conversation I do not remember that we actually used
many words&mdash;it was more as if atoms were flying between
us; and all the time there were those eyes looking like a
Madonna&rsquo;s from that saintly head, and that wonderful smile
with half-parted lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the banquet, when we were in the reception-room
with Her Majesty and the rest of the company, she
went to the window, and flinging open the shutters, painted
in the new Pompejan way, let in a flood of moonlight, and
stepped out on to the broad terrace, looking in her white
robes (Emma is fond of white) like a statue of a goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
against the glittering amethyst of the sky. I followed her,
and gazed where she pointed over the black shining mirror
of sea on which the moonlight lay in a great silver shaft;
but I had barely time to note the little red glow in the rifted
head of Vesuvio, and the great cone of Monte St. Angelo,
when she said&mdash;&lsquo;Not now, Nelson, with all these magnetic
human hearts so near us. I could walk for ever with you
in a scene like this, but I feel the Mesmer attraction
broken by those disturbing currents.&rsquo; Then she tripped
quickly back into the presence-chamber, with the girlishness
which is so much part of her. And then we joined my
officers, who, in spite of the very marked friendliness of Her
Majesty, were all collected in the exact centre of the room,
at the point farthest from the Queen and her ladies, at one
end, and the politicians, who ruin the country, at the other.
They were better at the French than at court: they did not
take naturally to this hobby-nobbying with Royalty. They
were not like Emma, who up to this had never&mdash;except
when we were for a brief visit to Naples&mdash;had any great
acquaintance with His Majesty&rsquo;s officers, but now it seemed
as if she were talking privately to every single man of them
at the same time. She is a host in herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We stayed on late; for, going up to the Queen to pay our
respects before leaving, we were by her detained, though
my officers took their leave earlier, and when we entered
My Lady&rsquo;s coach to drive back to the Embassy the moon
was down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We regretted the more our detention, because when
we arrived at home we were met at the door by the news
that Sir William was almost in a high fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have wrote, Emma was distracted: she ...
<i>Postscript written over leaf.</i></p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;2 a.m.&mdash;As I was throwing the sand upon these words,
in order to turn the page, I heard a timid knock at my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
door; and going to it quickly, for I had not get begun to
undress, I beheld Emma, looking more heavenly beautiful
than I had ever seen her before, in her white dressing-robe
made in the simple antique fashion, fastened only with a
girdle under the bosom, and with her glorious hair pouring
over her shoulders and almost to her knees, as I perceived
when she glided back the minute afterwards, lest her
husband should have opened his eyes and missed her
healing presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear friend,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I came to tell you that my
dear husband has taken the turn, and will now sleep.
I cannot forgive myself for having left him to-day: I had
not anticipated any increase in the fever so long as he
stayed at home, or wild horses should not have dragged
me. Forgive me, Nelson, for leaving you so abruptly.&rsquo;
With that she gave me her hands; and, looking at her
tender face, I perceived that it was stained with weeping.
I folded her to my heart; and presently she gently disengaged
herself, and fled back to sit by Sir William&rsquo;s
bedside through the night, to make sure of having Sir
William fit on the morrow for the twenty-mile drive to
Caserta, where the Queen is to join the King in the
morning, in order to bring about a meeting between me
and the Austrian General Mack, whom the Emperor has
sent down to command the Neapolitan forces in the contemplated
movement against the French in the Papal
States.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XV.</span>&mdash;Of the Voyage
to Malta, with the Account of
what happened at Caserta.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N writing this history of the Admiral, I had it in my
mind to have written each portion as it seemed to me
at the time, and not by the light of after experience;
but in practice I have not always found this possible.
I cannot, for instance, refrain from analysing his behaviour
during our short expedition to Malta by my knowledge of
how he was likely to behave under the circumstances
derived from a personal study of the hero during the last
seven years of his life.</p>

<p>Now, this voyage to Malta suggests to me that he had
not so completely convinced his conscience as the Journal
would lead us to suppose. When the Admiral was sick
at heart his indisposition was generally reflected in his
bodily health; but during this expedition to Malta, which
only lasted from the 15th of October to the 5th of
November, including the voyage there and back, which
took nine days going and five returning (our outward
voyage, it must be remembered, being round the Island
of Sicily instead of through the Strait of Messina), his
spirits were as high as I ever knew them except on the
eve of battle&mdash;as witness his treatment of the Marquis of
Niza, who commanded the Portuguese squadron. This
was in his very finest manner, both as a diplomatist and
as a bluff British sailor. The Marquis&rsquo; squadron was doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
sentry&rsquo;s work for us outside the harbour of Valetta, which
impregnable place the treachery or incapacity of the Grand
Master had surrendered to the French without a blow
being struck. This was the place which the Admiral said
that you could not get into, if it was undefended, because
you would want somebody inside to unlock the gates.
The situation was that the French had Valetta; but that
there were so few of them that the Maltese, who have only
the heart of a rabbit, retained the rest of the island, and
talked in a large way of the French surrendering. They
talked in such a large way, in fact, that every one in Naples
believed the French ready to surrender whenever the
islanders were supplied with arms and stores and money.</p>

<p>When our Admiral arrived, his instinct for grasping the
heart of a situation told him that, even against his audacity
and genius for attack, and his powerful ships, there was not
the likelihood of an early surrender. He observed that the
garrison had not begun to touch their bullocks; and decided,
after making arrangements for the proper conduct of the
blockade, to return to Naples, where he felt that his
presence could be of effect in putting the forces of the
kingdom into motion against the French.</p>

<p>Now, I will not say that he was not a vain man; but no
one can deny that his vanity took the form of recognising
the value of what he had achieved, and of almost boyish
pleasure in it, not of considering himself equal to doing
what was patently above his powers. If he had a high
opinion of what he could do, he bore it out with high
actions. Any vanity he had before the event was the
outcome of invincible courage, invincible confidence in his
officers and men, and a sense of duty to his country which
would not be satisfied without the completest results.</p>

<p>The kind of vanity of which the Admiral was guilty
before the event is shown by his behaviour at the late
battle, in which, with darkness coming on and without a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
chart, he took his fleet in to fight a squadron supported by
batteries and land forces, which had enjoyed all the time
they needed to make a position impregnable, actually
sending half his ships into the shallow water between the
French and the shore, to which they had anchored as close
as they thought safe.</p>

<p>Our Admiral&rsquo;s vanity before the event was of the do-and-die
sort; he was ready to face destruction at any instant
in order to take an advantage of an enemy who, not being
equally ready, left certain risks at his mercy. He recalls
to my mind the old story of the king who threw his
daughter&rsquo;s glove into a lion&rsquo;s den, and told her two suitors
that the first who brought it out should have her hand.
The Golden Knight asked the Silver Knight if they should
fight or draw lots to see who should have the privilege of
making the first attempt. The Silver Knight said that no
wife was worth such a risk, whereupon the Golden Knight
leaped into the midst of the lions and picked up the glove
without one of them offering to touch him. Our Admiral
was always ready to leap into a lion&rsquo;s den.</p>

<p>It was his vanity at this minute to consider that the
conduct of affairs in Naples depended on his presence; but
none the less, if he had believed that his presence could
have captured Malta, he would have stayed there until he
had captured it or died in the attempt. He was the last
man to leave a thing undone which he believed he could
do, and his idea of what might be achieved by desperate
valour the affair of Teneriffe had shown.</p>

<p>I had forgotten the Marquis of Niza, who had shown
considerable energy and good-will in blockading Valetta&mdash;for
which purpose, there being no likelihood of any French
line-of-battle ships appearing, Portuguese <em>of the line</em> did as
well as any other.</p>

<p>I cannot remember whether or no the Marquis was
an admiral in his own service, but he was at all events
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
superior in rank to any of the English officers left at Naples,
and conceived it to be essential to his dignity that he
should be recognised as being in command of the station
while he was there. The Admiral, in his character of
bluff British sailor dealing with a pretentious foreigner of
whose capacity he had had no sufficient proof, and whom
he could not believe to be comparable to Captain Troubridge,
the English senior officer on the station, who was only a
post-captain, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<i>Vanguard</i>, October 24th, 1798.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I am honoured with your Excellency&rsquo;s letter of
this evening, and in my public situation I have the honour to
acquaint you that I consider your Excellency as an officer serving
under my command, and standing precisely in the same situation
as an English Rear-admiral, junior to me; which is, having no
power or authority to give the smallest order to any Ship or
Vessel but those who I may think right to place, by order, under
your command.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;I have the honour to be, etc.,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the same day, being grateful to him for favours past
and to come, in his character of diplomatist he wrote to
him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;Off Malta, October 24th, 1798.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Having answered your public letter as my duty
called me to do, I beg leave to assure you of my very great respect
for your character, and that I shall not ever forget your zeal in
the blockade of this place. If your Excellency had recollected, I
am confident your knowledge of service would not have occasioned
you the trouble of writing me a letter. On service with us it is
necessary for the Commander-in-Chief, or the Officer Commanding

<p class="sig"><span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;I am, etc.,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Her Most Faithful Majesty&rdquo; was of course the Queen
of Portugal.</p>

<p>At Malta he did nothing beyond sending a <i>cartel</i> to the
French General and Admiral summoning them to surrender
Valetta, which they were within an ace of doing, although
our Admiral knew perfectly well the place was impregnable
to a force much superior to anything he had to bring against
it. But the Frenchmen plucked up their courage at the
last moment, so there was nothing for us to do except to
sail back to Naples, leaving a blockading force.</p>

<p>We had comparatively little intercourse with the people
on shore, for the Admiral found it hard to get over his
contempt for their braggadocio and feebleness in attack,
though there is a surprising amount of persistence in the
Maltese character. I, and I suppose other officers in the
<i>Vanguard</i> (I was now promoted lieutenant), were more
interested in rumours of love than rumours of war. My
Lady&rsquo;s undisguised admiration for the Admiral was naturally
a fruitful topic of conversation. It was still only a laughing
matter: not that any one ever laughed at our beloved
Commander&mdash;the jest was at her.</p>

<p>I knew more even on that matter than did most of them,
and I had also on my conscience Will&rsquo;s confidences. It
is strange how love breaks down pride. It had never
struck me that it was possible for Will Hardres to condescend
to confidences; but he had not been in love with
this slip of a girl above a week or two before he had to
cry <i>Peccavi</i> to me, just to have the pleasure of pronouncing
her name.</p>

<p>It had not, of course, escaped his shipmates that he
was paying her attention; but seeing that he was the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
officer on the three ships who could speak Italian (except
the <i>Vanguard&rsquo;s</i> chaplain, who did not count), they thought
it natural that he should devote himself to the most
beautiful girl at the Court. They of course knew nothing
of the obstacles in the way of such a proceeding in Sicily,
which were broken down in such an extraordinary manner,
and regarded his duel with her brother simply in the light
of an introduction.</p>

<p>Will was full of an afternoon which he had spent in her
company the day after our expedition to Pompeji and the
banquet at the Queen&rsquo;s Palace, at Caserta, whither the
Admiral had driven some twenty miles to dine and spend
the night. General Mack had arrived two days before,
and it was the desire of the Queen that these two should
know one another better, as the campaign seemed to depend
upon their concerted action.</p>

<p>The Admiral, who, as I have mentioned, had alluded to
the General in no very complimentary terms the night
before, at the Queen&rsquo;s banquet, was more favourably
impressed after a personal meeting: in fact, I have heard
him say afterwards, with a bitterness unusual in him, that
Mack owed his advancement in life to the power of giving
an impression of a capacity he did not possess. At the
time he said to Will, who was in attendance on him in his
private suite, taking certain orders from him before he
retired to bed&mdash;&ldquo;He is active and has an intelligent eye,
and will do well, I have no doubt. He assures us that the
Emperor has desired the King of Naples to begin, and he
will support him. Mack says he will march in ten days;
their Majesties have given him their confidence, and I feel
I am in full possession of it. The Queen was so impressed
with him that she could not help saying&mdash;&lsquo;General, be to
us by land what my hero Nelson has been by sea.&rsquo; I
have endeavoured to impress the General with a favourable
impression of me, and I think I have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
The Court was at Caserta, to which it paid frequent
visits in the summer and autumn&mdash;mainly, no doubt, at
this moment to be able to dispense with the unwelcome
presence of the French Ambassador while it was receiving
the General who had come from the Emperor to lead the
Neapolitan forces against the French. The Court could go
to Caserta without attracting much notice, because there
was a large portion still remaining of the old feudal forest,
among whose ilexes the King loved to hunt; and Her
Majesty, who was very wasteful, loved throwing away money
on the collection, under her personal superintendence, of
all the water in the neighbouring mountains for her artificial
waterfall, fifty feet high, and vast systems of fountains.
The Hamiltons generally went with them, and her adroit
Ladyship was at the pains to have about her persons of
position skilled in all the musical and theatrical diversions
in which the dissipated Court delighted.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of method in Her Majesty&rsquo;s mad
extravagances. Her waterworks employing so much labour
as they did, and being personally superintended by herself,
gave her the opportunity of conversing with all manner
of persons without exciting suspicion, and her enthusiasm
for dragging visitors round to see her operations gave her
the opportunity of taking people like the Admiral and
General Mack, whom she wished to consult, out of reach
of eavesdroppers. If they had been closeted together for
a great while in the Palace, all Naples would have discussed
what they had said or were supposed to have said; but if
they were being dragged to see the waterfall-tunnel, or the
casino of S. Leucio, which was quite three miles from the
Palace, it was nothing.</p>

<p>My Lady did not accompany them: walking exercise
fatigued her, though she would dance or stand about at a
reception for a number of hours.</p>

<p>The Queen commanded the attendance of one of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
ladies, and Donna Rusidda volunteered. The Admiral was
attended by Will. The General, for reasons of his own,
preferred not to have any of his staff with him. As he
promised a good deal more than he was justified in doing,
perhaps witnesses would have been inconvenient. My Lady
kept General Acton, the Prime Minister, who was tottering
for the moment, and therefore not to be trusted with secrets
till his position should be decided at least one way or
another. But I doubt not that the excuse on which she
kept him was that she had important confidences for him
from Her Majesty, which the others could not be allowed
to suspect.</p>

<p>Sir William was like the King. At really important
moments people were apt to forget him. And indeed he
was by no means well of the fever yet, though the drive
over the hills had invigorated him.</p>

<p>At a point the Queen bade Donna Rusidda show Will
the ancient trout which she had reared to such gigantic
proportions by hand-feeding with frogs, saying that she
would call when she needed her. And Donna Rusidda,
understanding this only for a polite dismissal while affairs
of state were being discussed, and having her brother&rsquo;s
permission to take with Will the liberty of an Englishwoman,
kept at a decent distance for the rest of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the Queen sat down on a bandstand, that
stood in the midst of the principal fountains, with open
sides, but roofed in the Chinese style, of which she was
so fond. Here, with the roof to protect them from the
sun, they could be sure of no one approaching them
unseen; and as fountains of almost every variety were
playing with extreme beauty, it was quite natural to sit
for a long hour to watch them. At a little distance off there
was an arbour to protect Will and Donna Rusidda from
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
&ldquo;W-Will,&rdquo; said she, as they sat down, &ldquo;is our friendship
a success?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for you to say. How could it be otherwise
for me, when it gives me the companionship of so charming
a lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not follow: people can be too good friends
as well as not good enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that I have not presumed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she replied: &ldquo;you have been what I knew I
could trust you to be&mdash;a model of honourable behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I been a dolt&mdash;a fool&mdash;in not recognising feelings
for which I did not dare to hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; she said, with a touch of <i>hauteur</i>, &ldquo;if
you had flattered yourself that such feelings existed, and had
presumed upon them, our friendship would have ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(I could hardly believe my ears when Will described
himself as having submitted tamely to such talk.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he replied, meaning it truly, and meaning
yet more truly that he was sorry; and he must have had
an expression which told the subtler truth, for she broke
into one of her rare smiles and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to hurt you, Signor Vill&rdquo;; and he
recovered himself, and corrected her&mdash;&ldquo;Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-W-W-Will.&rdquo; And then she burst out into a merry
little laugh.</p>

<p>(Lovers treasure up the smallest trifles of memory.)</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, he asked her in turn&mdash;&ldquo;And has our
friendship been a success?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for it lasts, and people
have accepted it. My brother has been out about it very
early this morning, but <em>he</em> was not hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you have to say about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means. This morning was the first of our
friendship, and I have hardly ever enjoyed a morning
so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
&ldquo;This morning?&rdquo; he said, with surprise mixed with
coldness. &ldquo;After we had arrived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly: how could I enjoy our friendship before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we did nothing this morning except sit about the
theatre watching My Lady arrange the scenery for her
Attitudes, and rehearsing a few mountebanks in their parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very severe, Signor W-Will. The Admiral
and I were in fits of laughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it very dull. My Lady&rsquo;s attitudes are
certainly wonderful; but I don&rsquo;t think that I care for them
so much that I want to see her in the morning arranging
the backgrounds for her performance at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she said, with considerable warmth and spirit.
&ldquo;In fact, I think we have too much <i>attitudes</i> altogether.
What does a man like your Admiral, a great hero who
is directing the destinies of the world, want with this
perpetual round of <i>attitudes</i>, <i>buffos</i>, <i>bals masqu&eacute;s</i>, and <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>?
They are all very well for us of the Two Sicilies, who have
to eat and drink and be merry until the flood comes and
swamps us into one of the great Powers; but a man like
your Admiral does not need them&mdash;he needs rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are sweeping, Donna Rusidda. After all,
when the stress of a severe campaign is over, what the
fighter requires is change more than rest. Men can go
to sleep while they are fighting at a battle, if they are only
weary enough. What the hard fighter and the hard
worker need is recreation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is this recreation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no recreation for me like the society of
beautiful and gracious ladies such as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed with mock gravity, and said, with a touch
of bitterness in her voice, &ldquo;You mean like the Ambassador&rsquo;s
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;she is very beautiful, wonderfully
and uniformly gracious, and very clever; but I do not like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
seeing the Admiral blind to her play-actress side. He
takes everything in her seriously, while I, who am a mere
boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always a boy, W-Will. You are sometimes a
boy with the wiseness of a man, and sometimes a man
with the foolishness of a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt the blood rushing to his face: her criticism was
rather franker than he liked, but she had addressed him
with greater familiarity than she had yet allowed herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not like her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, I will tell
you: your Admiral, who has a weasel&rsquo;s eye for the French,
may be caught napping by a woman; and she is very
much in love with him&mdash;as any woman might be,&rdquo; she
added, with a little tragedy sigh; &ldquo;for <em>men</em> are so scarce,
though you will be one some day, Signor W-Will.
And so you see she plays to him, with her beauty and
her engagingness, and her wisdom and her foolishness;
for the last card you play to the person, whose love you
wish very much, is your foolishness, which is the greatest
sacrifice you can offer.&rdquo; Then she continued: &ldquo;But it was
so comical her bringing us all&mdash;the Admiral and you and
General Mack and the whole Court&mdash;to see her arranging
her backgrounds, which you will all see made real by
lamplight this evening, as if it was a matter of such great
moment to us all to see a carpenter nail canvas to a post,
or a gardener bringing in a poor palm tree sawn off at
the roots to fit into a hole in the stage. Shall I tell you
what I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew all your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you shall know one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it is sometimes quite a fortunate thing to lose
your arm. For if the Admiral had not lost his arm he
might have had to nail up the canvas, or screw the palm
tree into the hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
Will gave a kind of groan, which she pretended not to
note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was much more entertaining for him to sit by&mdash;I
mean to sit in a box and watch a servant dancing
attendance on her ideas, which changed like a chameleon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will hoped so, but kept silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never enjoyed myself so much, Signor W-Will.
Your Admiral is so kind to ladies. Perhaps many of his
smiles were conversation, for he speaks so little Italian,
and I not much more English: you must teach me English,
Signor W-Will, that I may talk to him without giving
him trouble. Yes, our friendship is a great success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the Admiral joined them. The Queen and
General Mack had left off speaking French, and begun to
talk Austrian-German&mdash;most likely because they were very
interested about some point which they could not properly
explain to each other except in their native language. The
Admiral, however, who was very sensitive, took it as a
hint, and fell back to join Will and Donna Rusidda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you two happy people,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;with
nothing to talk about but yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was sad for Sicilians,&rdquo; she replied. By this time
she could understand English readily, though she spoke
it with difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how have you been entertaining yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was not; we was on duty, as you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, duty&mdash;excellent, as all our countries expect of us,
and generally give us precious little help in doing it, though
my Lord St. Vincent did give me the best ships afloat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was waiting for you for the pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral made his best bow, and he put on that
expression of his which reminded me of a dog pricking
its ears. General Mack had doubtless been a little prosy,
and occupied much of the conversation with what he was
going to do with the French when he had beaten them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, what pleasure are we going to begin with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall show to you the fountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said the Admiral. &ldquo;I have been looking at
them, you know, on the sly, while the General was composing
the proclamation which he is going to make to the
cities of the Peninsula.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you shall not have seen them&mdash;all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Admiral, pretending to be offended,
&ldquo;I have, as you please to notice, only one eye; but I think
that the French at any rate will allow that I am a pretty
good hand at taking in the whole situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit-oo-ation,&rdquo; she repeated, laughing; &ldquo;that is a good
word. No, I do not think that you have&mdash;how can I say&mdash;caught&mdash;yes,
caught the whole sit-oo-ation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, I hope I shall never contradict a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shall see a fine sit-oo-ation. First we shall
go in the <i>barca</i>,&rdquo; she cried, jumping into a light boat, which
was moored to the marble steps of the artificial lake. She
made Will row, while she sat in the stern with the Admiral,
pointing out the exquisite little temples and marble nymphs
and couches and bridges with which the lake, which was
really more like a little river running between and round
a number of little islands full of the rarest and most picturesque
exotics, was studded. Will rowed with alacrity.
The Admiral was clearly enjoying himself, and anything
that gave him the least gratification was the sincerest
pleasure to Will: he did not note that he was being left
out of the conversation. Presently Donna Rusidda demanded
to be landed in a beautiful <i>rosetum</i>, in which the
roses were trained round a framework into a huge green
crown, a model of that worn by Her Majesty&rsquo;s mother, the
great Empress Maria Theresa. There were quite a number
of hoops to it, and the rose flowers made the gems; while
the leaves changing with the autumn&mdash;the season in which
it was intended to be seen&mdash;gave a golden colour to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
ribs. In the centre of it, underneath the boss which
contained the great gem of the real crown, was a vase of
immense value&mdash;ancient Grecian of the best period&mdash;lying
on the ground, which looked as if it had fallen but recently
from the slender marble &ldquo;stele&rdquo; of a satyr with four faces,
brought from the excavations at Pompeji.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Signor W-Will, the wind has blow over Her
Majesty&rsquo;s favourite vase!&rdquo; Naturally, Will sprang forward
to replace it; and, balancing it with great care, started to
rejoin them where they were standing on a beautiful tesselated
pavement, adorned with the signs of the Zodiac.
All of a sudden, from dozens of little jets, a great shower
of water met him full in the face. He dashed back to get
out at the other side, only to meet another shower, which,
coming into play on him from a greater distance, was more
like spray. He tried a third path, and again met the spray;
but, grasping that all the paths were similarly commanded,
dashed through it and the heavier shower which greeted
him nearer, and flew to the pavement where they were
standing, looking like a seal. Something in the pavement
caught his eye, and, looking more closely, he perceived that
each Zodiacal sign had for its centre mosaic a little bronze
cube, raised slightly above the rest. Donna Rusidda shrieked
with laughter as he put his foot on the whole twelve in
succession, starting the shower on each of the corresponding
twelve paths of the leafy crown of Austria; and the Admiral,
though he would have been sorry for Will if he had reflected,
gave the great roar of laughter in which he indulged whenever
he was extravagantly tickled. He was a boy all his
life, in the intervals of anxiety caused by the blindness of
the Government, on whom he depended for ships and
supplies to strike at the French, and irritation and depression
caused by his wretched health. He had, as his whole
behaviour during the sojourn in the Two Sicilies showed,
a thorough appreciation of the masqueradings and buffooneries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
and practical jests which are to the Neapolitan part
of his everyday life, and to the grave Sicilian an occasional
recreation. These water-mazes are very popular with the
rich; and in some instances, like the present, immense
sums are spent on their construction: indeed, they form
the staple of amusement at an excursion to an unfamiliar
palace or villa, where only one or two are in possession of
the knowledge where the traps lie. You are safe nowhere:
the shower may be lying in wait for lovers in a retired
walk, or for a whole company on the most frequented lawn.
But the water is laid on more lightly for the most part than
Donna Rusidda laid it on for Will.</p>

<p>Will was in high dudgeon; he had no liking for practical
jests at any time, and this being put into a ridiculous and
humiliating light before the woman he loved, maddened
him. If it had been a man who had played the jest upon
him he would have thrashed him first, and fought a duel to
the death afterwards&mdash;if the thrashed person wished to carry
the matter further. And though the Admiral had taken no
part in the jest, his very presence, had he been any other
man, would have been sufficient for hot-headed Will. But
the Admiral was to him hardly a human being,&mdash;he reverenced
him so, and owed him such a debt of gratitude; and
so there was nothing for it but to walk behind them with
his laced hat and blue coat, and the nankeen breeches
whose fit had been his pride, for they could hardly have
been closer if they had been carved in marble, looking like
shrunk grapes.</p>

<p>The Admiral, by this, was woefully sorry for him; for
that great man did not forget small things, and it was in
his mind that only in the few days that they had been back
in Naples had Will possessed a lieutenant&rsquo;s uniform of his
own, and that the English tailor to the Sicilian court charged
as exiles will who leave their homes not to save their lives
but to fill their purses. It brought to his mind a boyish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
figure which he had seen only six months since standing
outside his state-room door getting well dripped in his new
midshipman&rsquo;s rig, because he would not come in under the
lee of his mother till he had received the command of his
officer. He remembered also that the little fair slip of
a mother was none too well clad to come aboard a ship
tossing at her anchors in a stiff cold gale off St. Helen&rsquo;s,
and that that same little mother had said to him, &ldquo;You will
take care of him, Sir Horatio ... I do not mean in the face of
the enemy, but I have only a slender purse; his father was
killed when he was a lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral&rsquo;s money was always burning holes in his
pockets, and he made up his mind <i>instanter</i> to present Will
with a new outfit, so that what he had on might dry for his
second best.</p>

<p>Just for the present Will was too hurt and too humiliated
to think of his poverty, as he stalked a few paces behind
Donna Rusidda and the Admiral, who, having made up his
charitable resolve, soon melted again under the smiles of
the beautiful girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be much better if you had not seen the all
sit-oo-ation,&rdquo; said Donna Rusidda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can easily make that all right,&rdquo; answered the
Admiral cheerily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so? I think the Signor W-Will he look like
the thunder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think he looks more like the rain; but he can
thunder, I assure you, and lighten too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I oughted not to do it, but in Naples it is very
droll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I had rather you had done it to me, or
to my captain. I always make a point of considering a
boy&rsquo;s pride more than a man&rsquo;s. I was a very little chap
when I first went to sea, Princess. The first thing the
boatswain said when he saw me, was that I was not long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
for this world. But I have cheated him,&rdquo; he continued,
cutting a comical little caper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not speak it too soon, Eccellenza: you are not so old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not old!&mdash;why, I am forty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ambassador&rsquo;s wife she gave the ball on your
native day, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded pleasantly, with a smile at her English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had the earth under your feet before you were of
forty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mostly sea, Princess, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have spoken <em>world</em> instead of <em>earth</em>, is it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Princess, I was but jesting to turn off your
flattery. I understood you perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please not to jest against my English, Eccellenza,&rdquo; she
begged, with a rich rush of colour to her dusky cheeks: &ldquo;I
feel the <i>mauvaise honte</i> at speaking it, but strive to defeat
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady! you make me feel more ashamed
of myself than the whole French fleet could. If I were to
wrestle with your language, as you do with mine, you
would keep in such a fit of laughing that you could not
understand a single word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will noted the look of unutterable gratitude on the girl&rsquo;s
face, and put down the whole Sicilian nation as more
theatrical than My Lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take it unhappily, if I speak something,
Eccellenza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am sure I shall not: you may say anything you
like to me,&rdquo; he replied gallantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ambassador&rsquo;s wife she is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the loveliest woman on earth,&rdquo; he said warmly,
&ldquo;and the best. There never was a woman so good-hearted,
and so thoroughly good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She loves you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for the sake of our country, Princess. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
patriotism takes the form of gratitude to me, who have
been fortunate enough to be intimately connected with the
salvation of her country before her eyes. I am not to her a
mere man, but the saviour of England, and the Sicilies, from
the wicked murderous French. Nelson the man is nothing
to her. He is, as you see, a little one-eyed, one-armed
being, obliged to brush his hair over his forehead to hide
an untidy scar. If she thought of the man at all she would
think of a big fine man like Captain Troubridge; and if she
is a bit motherly to me, why, so she is to my mids, and
it&rsquo;s all because I&rsquo;m such a poor little thing playing hide-and-seek
with fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Miladi has the mother&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; she said slowly,
as if the words were extorted from her; &ldquo;but the mother&rsquo;s
heart it is a woman&rsquo;s heart, and what woman, not of the
enemy, would not find her heart&mdash;graz-ee-us is it you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, gracious&mdash;that is what she is, a woman of
women. There is no one like her&mdash;so generous, so enthusiastic,
so truly noble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very <i>lov-ly</i>; and how are other women to
show that they have such hearts to the liberator of their
country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By attending to the comforts of my officers and
sailors. We brought many badly wounded with us, who
need the attention of women to give them back their full
manhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>H&eacute;las!</i> it is not possible. Our women have not such
hearts; they could not give tenderness without also their
love. But the English, they are not so. To us friendship
between man and woman is like fire: we may warm the
tips of our fingers at a&mdash;I do not know your word&mdash;<i>scaldino</i>,
but we cannot have your English open fires, for
we have not the chimneys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eccellenza!&rdquo; called the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;Coming, Your Majesty,&rdquo; answered the Admiral, hopping
off. They were very great friends, the Queen and the
Admiral, and mingled playfulness with the most solemn
and important business. Very likely Her Majesty had
diplomatic reasons. It is quite easy to give the numbers of
an army to a man who is playing ball with you, or trying
to take off a <i>pulcinello</i>.</p>

<p>Donna Rusidda turned round to Will, who was still
very grim and hurt, and looked as though he would give
his whole prospects to hide himself in the little Saracen
building which the Queen had erected as a kind of summer-house,
and which was the last piece of shelter before the
Palace, that rose with the splendour and solitariness of a
temple half a mile away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh W-Will,&rdquo; she said, returning with great relief to
Italian, &ldquo;I am sorry. Go in there, and I will tell you
what I will do for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house stood in a little thicket of laurels, from which
only its flat terraced roof and turret were visible at the
Palace.</p>

<p>He did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, W-Will,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;There is no one
here to see you, and it is very comfortable. You can quite
well stay here until I have a change sent to you. I do not
love the Ambassador&rsquo;s wife, but she is generous-hearted,
and if I tell her what I have done, and how sorry I am, I
know she will see that you get your change without any
one knowing it, except your servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a little mollified, but stood irresolute. She
laid her hand on his arm to draw him in; her touch
thrilled him, and he could resist no longer, especially when,
with a sudden impulse, she bent low and kissed his hand,
saying: &ldquo;I have a confession to make&mdash;will you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will: how can I help it?&rdquo; he replied, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
still with a touch of something&mdash;anger or hurt&mdash;in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not speak till you have heard,&rdquo; she said anxiously,
and not far from weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I cannot help forgiving you anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it is so,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;for it needs much
forgiveness what I am about to tell you. I did it because
you are so handsome&mdash;such a <i>grand seigneur</i>: I could
not bear to think that that little homely-looking man with
his plainly-fitting clothes, the greatest man in all the
world, should look nothing&mdash;one of the people&mdash;if it were
not for the leadership written in his face, beside one of
his officers&mdash;a mere boy. Yes, you are a mere boy,
W-Will, or I would not have done it to you; and I did
it to make him laugh at you, and to humiliate you before
him, that he might be exalted in my imagination and look
like a conqueror. Now strike me or kill me: I have told
you the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusidda,&rdquo; said Will, addressing her thus for the first
time, and taking her hands to hold her, while he looked
into her burning face as if he were going to see through
into her soul, &ldquo;you have hurt me on my tenderest point;
but I have forgiven you, because no one saw it but yourself
and my Admiral, and him I so worship and reverence that
I would go through not only death but humiliation for his
sake. And you I love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her great grey Sicilian eyes, which could look black or
blue in certain lights, and which had been fixed nervously
on his, fell before his gaze, and he thought that she was
won. She let him kiss her without resisting, and it was a
good many seconds before she could find words to stem the
impetuous torrent of love in which he half besought her,
half claimed her for his wife after all. At last she managed
to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-Will&mdash;yes, I can call you dear W-Will&mdash;I can never
marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he broke in: &ldquo;you cannot have become
betrothed to another, or you would not have spoken as
you have about friendship. I know how strict is the
etiquette of your Sicilian betrothals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I am not betrothed,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;nor ever
can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not under a monastic vow?&rdquo; he asked. He
knew nothing of such vows, but felt that now, when all
Europe was a battle-field, the sword might find a way
to cut many knots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of my family have ever taken the vow,&rdquo; she said
proudly; &ldquo;it has been part of the code handed down from
our Norman ancestor, who won his principality by bearding
the Pope. If we had had a few cardinals in the family,
we should not have been as poor as we are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor?&rdquo; he said, the word arresting him. &ldquo;I shall
not always be poor in these fighting days. Each of our
captains will have a thousand pounds out of the three
prizes we burnt at the Nile, not to mention the prizes
we saved; and even I shall have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;I was not thinking of that.
I would marry you if I could love you, W-Will, if you had
not a <i>carlin</i> but your pay, and had to live when you
were on shore in the tower, which is about all of the
Favara we inhabit. You would have to live on oranges
and polenta and Indian figs, and perhaps we could buy
a little macaroni sometimes,&rdquo; she added, forcing a smile.
&ldquo;We are so poor, we two, the last of the House of Favara,
that we have to let our domain to a farmer for orange
and lemon growing, and let him use part of our palace
for his business. We could not live if we were not in
the household of the Queen. It is not poverty that
prevents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what is it, dear?&rdquo; asked Will. She still let him
kiss her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, just that I cannot ever marry you, because I
cannot ever love you, as I know Englishwomen love
their husbands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will marry you, and gladly, even thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, W-Will, I could not marry you&mdash;I cannot even
think of it. It is quite impossible. All I can be to you is
your very dearest friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I not try to win you from your decision?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you have any mercy on me,
try, and I will pray the Mother of God that you may
prevail: but alas! it is not, is not, possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I kiss you when we are like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ghost of a smile flitted across his face as he caught
sight of himself in a mirror which had a Chinese landscape
painted on it. His smile bore fruit: it brought her back
to herself. She laughed&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, dear W-Will; kiss me,
woo me your very best way, and win me&mdash;do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will was very thankful for that laugh, that sudden
return to her self-possession and everyday voice. To a
man of his sensitive temperament it is not easy to act on
such a permission from a woman highly strung; he feels
that he is taking advantage of her weakness&mdash;that he is
acting on a submission she would not have made in calmer
moments. But if she gives the same permission when she
is calmed down, and with a little laugh, he feels that he is
playing fair.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI.</span>&mdash;What the Admiral
wrote in his Journal about
Love.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE these two were acting in this strange love
scene, the three personages upon whom they
were nominally in attendance were planning
measures which were to overturn, in a few days, all that
the halting diplomacy of the Emperor had built up in many
months. The Queen, who had contrived to make of our
Admiral her faithful Minister, urged the matter forward
to force the head of her house, the Emperor, to make a
decided movement and march his armies down into the
Peninsula against the French. By his sending her a
general she took it for granted that he meant to support
her with his soldiers as soon as she began fighting, which
seems to have been very far from his thoughts&mdash;a fact,
of course, known to General Mack. But the latter had
neither the honesty nor the capacity to give such a message
to the beautiful and eager Queen, and allowed her to
deceive herself. He trusted (now that Buonaparte was
away in Egypt and without a fleet) to a French scuttle
before the numbers of the Neapolitans, and the English
ships, which threatened their land communications by the
Riviera Road.</p>

<p>Sir William might have taken a severer view, if indeed
he was capable of taking any view at this time. Sir
William was not a strong man. Having the good fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
to be the foster-brother of King George III., he was
appointed to the Court of Naples, probably as a kind of
sinecure, when the prospect of Naples becoming the key
to the European situation seemed as remote as any earthly
contingency. Possibly he had qualifications then; but, at
all events, as he grew older, they disappeared, and he
became, by the agency of his able and ambitious wife, a
mere appendage to the Court of Naples. And now he was
having one of his periodical visitations of the bilious fever,
which had kept him from the Pompeian expedition (where
his antiquarian knowledge would have been highly interesting
to the Admiral) and the Queen&rsquo;s banquet. Being
somewhat recovered, and the air of Caserta having so often
proved beneficial during similar attacks, he had driven up
in the morning, and, indeed, was so far recovered by night
that he determined with the Queen and the Admiral to
return to Naples on the following day.</p>

<p>His improvement was maintained there. But as he grew
older his attacks became longer and more difficult to shake
off, and he was both averse to work and incapable of
energy at the moment when opposition would have counted.</p>

<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 12th the Court
and all the guests had flitted, and they were in Naples in
time for a very early midday meal, ordered by a courier
sent overnight. For what follows I am indebted to the
Admiral&rsquo;s own Journal, which is again borne out by facts
within the personal knowledge and perfect memory of Will.</p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;<i>Oct. 12th.</i>&mdash;Sir William has borne the journey pretty
well, but knowing how anxious Emma must be about him,
I determined to accept the Queen&rsquo;s very pressing invitation
to luncheon at the Palace, and immediately afterwards to
excuse myself and go down to the dockyard. It has been
my invariable custom, when ships under my command
have been refitting, to go down and inspect them personally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
although I have never found the ships&rsquo; officers less careful
than myself, or less capable of judging efficiency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I attribute the successes, with which the Lord
has been pleased to grace my battles, to the efficiency of
of my officers and men, coupled with my unalterable
principle to seek my enemy as fast and as near as ever I
can get to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not lunch at the Queen&rsquo;s table after all, for I found
that the very early lunch resolved itself into light refreshment
directly we arrived, and the usual interminable meal an
hour or two afterwards, which is Her Majesty&rsquo;s foundation
for the siesta. So I determined to go off to the dockyard
on a biscuit and a glass of <i>lachrime Christi</i>, which was
served to us as a fillip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one of the Queen&rsquo;s ladies, a certain Princess of
Favara, to whom I once had the honour of doing a small
service in a delicate matter, insisting that it was the height
of imprudence for a man but lately recovered from the
fever to spend a long day in the sun on no better
preparation, with her own hands brought me the breast
of a fowl and some champagne, which she obtained from
one of the servants. She is a lady of marked beauty, and
has, if I mistake not, a feeling for my scapegrace Will.
Her deference to me, as an elderly man and the commander
of the good Allies of her Sovereign, is very graceful, and
does her good taste great credit; for it is not necessary for
a maid of honour, especially of her high birth, to take any
notice of one whom only the accident of politics has
introduced at the Court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oct. 12th. At night.</i>&mdash;Matters at the dockyard on the
whole satisfactory, though for war-ships to take three
weeks to re-fit&mdash;oh Lord! But then their appliances are
miserable, and there are hardly any stores to speak of, and
in this country nothing is ever ready or well done, except
a <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hardly saw dear Emma all day. Sir William, though
he has borne the journey pretty well, has these bilious
fevers so very seriously now, that he needs the closest
watching. I saw her, for a minute, when I came back
from the dockyard for dinner with the Queen, but I had
cut the time so fine that it was the barest minute. I found
the dinner very long. I had matters of the first moment
to discuss with nearly every one around me, but had to be
mum. This cursed place is so full of spies. One never
knows that the fellow who takes away your broken victuals
may not be a French diplomatist, equal in rank to a
Secretary of Legation, playing the spy! So we had to fall
back on the usual table talk,&mdash;scandal, almost the only
topic in which it is safe to indulge, and one which includes
every one in Naples, except those who are present, who
will have their turn on their first absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner over&mdash;and the gentlemen did not stay at their
wine&mdash;after a short conversation with the Princess, who is
the only one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s ladies who takes much pains
to speak English, at which she is becoming quite intelligible,
we went off to a consultation, which was to be followed by
what Her Majesty has christened a Session, not a Council,
in order that she may not have to summon the whole of
her Ministers. This, of course, is aimed at the Marquis
de Gallo, the War Minister, who is tottering and to be
replaced. I am glad of this, for I detest him. He is as
ignorant a fellow of common civility as he is of his duties.
Sir William, whose health is better to-day, drove up for the
consultation, at which De Gallo was also present; and I was
led to believe that promises of protection, with supplies of
arms, ammunition, and provisions (as I understood from
the Governors of Syracuse and Messina), had been given to
the inhabitants of Malta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I returned with Sir William in his coach to the Embassy,
when he at once retired for the night, under care of Emma,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
who was waiting anxiously to receive him. I also retired.
I was, indeed, glad, for more than one reason, to be in the
quiet of my chamber. Here in Naples one lives in one&rsquo;s
bedchamber when one is alone; for it is furnished for
receptions, and its own reception-rooms, attached to it, are
mere ante-chambers, where one receives tradesmen, or
those who would weary one of their business, instead of
admitting them into one&rsquo;s privacy. The operations in the
dockyard had kept me a good deal on my legs and much in
the sun; and I remembered the moonlight scene of which I
had been deprived on the night of the Queen&rsquo;s banquet, so,
after dinner, when My Lady retired to Sir William, who
was dining in his own apartment&mdash;not caring to be present
when there were dishes that he favoured, but of which he
dare not partake, for he is a great connoisseur&mdash;I went up
to my chamber and bade my man, Tom Allen, fling open
windows and shutters in the corner which commanded the
Bay. When he had done this, &lsquo;Begging your pardon, sir,&rsquo;
he said, saluting me, &lsquo;shall you be needing me any more
to-night?&rsquo; It is my habit, when I am alone, to give him
leave off when I do not require his services. He is a good
fellow, Tom, though the queerest-looking fish, and, indeed,
the queerest fish who was ever allowed to appear as the
servant of a public man. He is a good fellow, but he
irritates me with his over-care for my health, so I am glad
to be rid of him till midnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is, it seems, to be some kind of a gala for the men
of the fleet at Virgil&rsquo;s tomb, on the face of the Hill of
Pausilippo, which is to be decorated with many lamps and
&lsquo;N.V.&rsquo; in roses, the V. representing Victory and not Virgil&mdash;who
is, however, esteemed a great witch among the
<i>lazzaroni</i>. I was glad to be rid of the good Tom, for in a
minute he would have been busying in to close the windows.
Naples and the <i>mal&rsquo; aria</i> spell the same thing to him; and it
was so heavenly to see the large open squares of dark-blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
starlit sky as I was sitting at my table intending to confess
to you, Pen. But no confessions would come, so I rose and
walked to the windows, from the right hand of which I could
distinctly see the glare of the lamps, with which they were
decorating Virgil in my honour, in his vineyard on the hill
of Pausilippo, and the crescent of flickering lights from the
Cape to the end of the Thuilleries. But the other interested
me more, for from it I could see the calm, gently-heaving
sea, with the lanterns of the fisher-boats bobbing round the
rocks, and the flashing port-holes of my squadron, and a
broad shaft of moonlight on the water, which made Capri
just visible at the far end, and seemed to bring out every
stone in the lofty walls of the strong Castle of Uovo and
the long narrow drawbridge from the Castle to the gate-tower,
and the gate-tower to the shore. And, much as in
my heart I despise Naples for the lightness with which she
gives herself over to fiddling and illuminations the moment
the darkness, which the Neapolitans love as other people
love the light, supervenes, I must confess that it added
greatly to the gaiety of the scene upon which I looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I stood by the window, half angry, half adoring the
Naples which has made me so happy with the first perfect
companionship my life has known, I felt a hand upon my
shoulder, a woman&rsquo;s face against my neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My Nelson,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the room where I had crooned
Sir William asleep was dark, and the moonbeams came in,
and I remember how I deprived you two nights ago, and I
came to this room, which is the only one that sweeps the
Bay, to share the moonlight with you. Say that you would
not have cared for it so much without me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not speak&mdash;my heart was too full for words; but
one can say without words the deepest things in one&rsquo;s
nature, and as I stood with my hand round her side, she
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My mother has taken my place for two hours, to let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
get some rest now that my dear husband is recovering.&rsquo;
And then, suddenly turning round, she looked at me with
all her soul in her eyes, that were wont to be so full of
laughter, though with her mouth she ever smiled more than
laughed, and even now those exquisite lips were parting in
a tender smile. I do not know to what I can compare them,
except crimson rose-leaves laid lightly on the whitest and
most perfect teeth in the world. And the little straight
nose, which gives the face its merry, mischievous air when
she is laughing, gave it now, with its delicate nostrils, a
touching air of femininity. I could see every little womanly
perfection in the dazzling white moonlight which poured
into the window. She stood a little like this, and then she
inclined her gracious head to whisper: &lsquo;And what rest is
there for me like a quiet hour with you&mdash;the saviour of our
countries, the hero of my heart! Everything here breathes
to me of you. If I look out on to the Bay, the serried lines
of lights show me ships which fought in your victory, the
greatest the sea has ever seen. If I look on the land,
wherever I see a flare of light, or hear a band of music, I
know that they are celebrating you. The Queen, in her
palace, has your heroic name hardly ever off her lips; and
here, in my palace, every soul is thinking and talking of
you; and <em>I</em> worship you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We stood for a short time almost in silence, taking in,
with dreaming eyes, the gentle lights, the soft Southern
moonlight, the crowning stars; and then I led her to the
door, and kissing her reverently on the threshold, bade
her go and take her much-needed rest. She hesitated for
a few moments; then, flinging her arms round me, she
kissed me with oh, such tenderness, and looked into my
eyes. Then she released me, and saying&mdash;&lsquo;My Lord&rsquo;s
first command!&rsquo; glid swiftly away, without so much as
looking round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oct. 13th. Later.</i>&mdash;I have played at being a coward, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
run away, the first time in my life except from the storm
at Teneriffe,&mdash;I protest that it was the storm and not the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Emma went, I began to recognise the full extent
of my peril. Suppose I had not been strong, and had
tried to rob her of her rest by detaining her instead of
prescribing as her physician. Incidental caresses are beautiful,
tender, endearing things. But to abandon yourself
to a banquet of them on a Neapolitan autumn night, in
the darkness and silence of a great house, hushed for a
fever patient&mdash;a banquet of caresses with the loveliest
woman in the world&mdash;and not a human soul to save you
from falling in love! No, already I love Emma as much
as an English gentleman may love a friend&rsquo;s wife. She
is to me the most beautiful, affectionate, loyal, respectable
woman alive; and she has such a perfect freedom from
<i>mauvaise honte</i>, as we used to say when I was studying
that vile language at St. Omer, that she permits herself
to grant me all the innocent caresses she would grant a
brother. And she trusts herself with me too much. Pray
God I may not mean these words &lsquo;too much.&rsquo; I hope I am
a gentleman. But I mean that she is too trustful, if I were
a villain.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>&ldquo;Why did I let her go? There was no hurry; we were
doing no harm,&mdash;nothing. It was restful for both of us,
that standing side by side and pressure of friendly hands.
I do not believe I ever felt so perfectly at peace with the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the point remains, <i>quo vadis?</i> One cannot be perfectly
certain, as certain as I should like to be, of anything
stopping at a given point. And this soft air, this soft scene
take away the powers of resistance. To yield to the
temptation to love or kill seems natural here&mdash;to kill, not
in the fierce rough-and-tumble of the North, but with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
stab in the back, the poisoned bowl, or the measured duello
of the South.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must leave this. Nay, I will leave it this very night.
I cannot sail for Malta, let me see, for one&mdash;two days; but
I can take up my quarters on my ship, and the same
healthy breath of the ocean blows on every sea. Even
in this beautiful Circean Bay I shall be myself there&mdash;and
fling away soft imaginations and soft longings, and think
of the French!</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; 12 p.m.</i>&mdash;Since I wrote the above, I have
had a cocked hat full of strange adventures. I made up
my mind to leave the Embassy there and then, lest dear
Emma should come back after her sleep to bid me good-night
before she returned to Sir William, and I should
be weak and try to detain her. Buckling on my sword,
I went down to the <i>portiere</i>, and asked him if a coach were
procurable to take me to the Santa Lucia landing. I had not
my pistols with me at the Embassy, because there could be
no chance of my needing them, so I thought I would take
a coach; for Naples has none too savoury a reputation
at night. Unfortunately there was no coach to be had&mdash;Emma
and Sir William having many horses and every
variety of vehicle, and the Embassy standing a little outside
the city gate. Besides, all the coaches in the near part
of the city were gone to my f&ecirc;te at Virgil&rsquo;s. The <i>portiere</i>
was for knocking the men up and giving me one of Sir
William&rsquo;s coaches, which he said would take but a very
few minutes, the men sleeping in their clothes, except
their livery coats, which I consider an unhealthy habit.
But of this I would not hear, fearing lest Emma should get
the wind. I doubted my strength to go in the face of her
hospitable entreaties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;try for a <i>vettura</i>.&rsquo; As he prophesied,
no <i>vettura</i> was forthcoming, so I determined to walk down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
to the landing&mdash;a very little way. I stepped out at a brisk
pace; but when I was under the shadow of the hill which
Sir William tells me is Pal&aelig;polis, the original citadel of
the Greek city, now called Pizzofalcone, under which are
clustered some cabins of the lowest class, I was set upon
by three or four fellows. Luckily, contrary to my usual
custom, I had buckled my sword upon my right-hand side,
where I could draw it; and so I whipped it out to defend
myself; and spitting the first of them in the stomach,
which I knew to be more effective at a pinch than a slash
from a man of my small stature, set my back against
a wall of the kind which they use for poor buildings in
these parts, and which I knew to be there. As they came
on, in my excitement, I forgot about the spitting, and
splashed for my life. And it saved my life: for a fellow
to whom I gave a pretty cut, knew by the shoulder that
he was fighting a left-handed man, and called out in the
Neapolitan lingo words among which were &lsquo;The Admiral!
the Liberator of our country!&rsquo; Instantly the onslaught
ceased, and all of them, including he whom I had spitted
and the man whose shoulder I had slashed, knelt before
me; and though I cannot understand the Neapolitan lingo,
I felt sure that they were craving my forgiveness, which
I was well ready to grant them, for the rascals had such
a respect for their skins that, though there were four of
them against a one-armed man, they had not come to
quarters close enough to use their dangerous knives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain strange noises in the nature of signals then
followed; and in a very few minutes I was surrounded by
above a hundred of the <i>lazzaroni</i>, one of whom, speaking a
few words of English, as is not uncommon in this port,
explained that they were going to form a kind of bodyguard
for me, to prevent any similar mishap from French sympathisers.
This I was glad to accept, both in acknowledgment
of the spirit that offered it, and because I knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
evil-disposed persons, favouring the French, had given some
trouble by lurking near the landing to pay off national
scores on my seamen straggling home in liquor. I gave
each of the men I had bled a guinea, and I dare swear that,
as soon as they are healed, they will be ready for more
blood-letting on the same terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came near more letting of blood at the landing
steps, for who should be there but Will! and there was a
magnificent illumination of three oil lamps, by which he
recognised me, surrounded by my evil-looking guard. Without
pausing to reckon that they were more than a hundred
to his one, he drew his sword, and was for cutting his way
to me, but at the same time called to the sleepy drab of a
Neapolitan watchman to fire his piece and give the alarm,
which he promptly did, it being astonishing how soon these
fellows are waked when they scent danger. Fortunately I
stopped Will<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> before he cut down any of my protectors,
and almost immediately a well-armed boat from the <i>Vanguard</i>
came racing in to the steps. Warned by a few
mischances, the Captain had ordered a patrol to lie off
nightly, from darkness to daylight.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a></span>
Will has a perfect memory of the incident, and every detail is
given as he remembers it. He describes the situation as being
almost the most extraordinary in which he ever saw the Admiral.
They had a few torches, such as the fishermen use when they are
harpooning the great cuttle-fish which form such a favourite article
of diet at Naples, and the Admiral was in their centre, it seemed to
him at first, as a prisoner.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Turning for a minute to speak to the officer in command
of the boat, to my astonishment, on facing about again, I
found every man of my <i>lazzaroni</i> melted into thick darkness.
They were conscious, I suppose, of being the worst rogues
in Naples, and fancied that their relations to me, which had
taken such a sudden and favourable change, might be misinterpreted.
And volleys are quicker than explanations.
The officer wished to know if he should take me off to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
flagship, which, on learning the nature of his duty, I would
not allow, for it was easy for some poor seaman, half seas
over, to be in the same fix as I had been, and not to get off
so handsomely. There was a boat, too, coming off for
Will, so he said, and I fancied that I could hear the rowlocks
even then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been at sea pretty well all my life, and at Naples
but two or three weeks, and yet I own I hardly expected
to find the machine working so perfectly when I stepped
back into it. For those three weeks had been three weeks
of such topsy-turvy&mdash;more like the Italian opera than life.
Yet here was the well-appointed boat, with no one taking
any notice of me beyond saluting, even Will, who sat by
me, not speaking until I addressed him. When I reached
the ship&rsquo;s side and ascended the gangway, the few men
who were about at that hour, with the sentries and officers
of the watch, were all at the salute, and seemed to have been
waiting for my return every minute, since I had landed.
My state-room and cabin were lighted, the sentry stood at
the door, and everything was arranged to my hand as it
would be if I had never left the ship, though my man Tom
is ashore, and, by the time, I should judge, still with Virgil.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>&ldquo;I have been on the poop for I know not how long,
pacing up and down and feeling a better man. The sea
breeze has blown away all doubts. I must put to sea in
two days and get rid of all this. It is not often that I am
glad to go to sea, when there is no more to be done than I
have hopes of at Malta. I would I could go to Alexandria,
and finish those French transports, so that not a man of the
Grand Army should ever come back to Europe. I have
asked the Grand Signor for a few bombs and fireships,
which he should, by this time, have sent. With that not
one of them will escape. This is much more to my mind
than lying at anchor off Naples; and about this Malta
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
business, too, I fear that His Majesty is misinformed. It
is represented that the French are on the point of surrender
to the Islanders, and that the grant of so much arms,
ammunition, and money, which the Governor of Syracuse
is considered to have sent, will make Valetta ready to fall
as soon as they sight our topsails. This I do not expect.
The Maltese are liars and braggarts, though they can fight
pretty well when it comes to a choice between fighting and
being butchered like sheep. Unless Valetta has reached
the starvation point&mdash;and I think it has not&mdash;even my
fleet could not reduce it by bombardment or assault; and
the Maltese might be allowed to attack it from now till the
crack of doom, without the defenders needing to fire a
single gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still the French have more than once lost heart when
their communications have been cut off; and if I go to
Malta and summon them from my ships,&mdash;&lsquo;who knows?&rsquo;
as the Spaniards say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not able to go to Egypt to serve my country,
because of this affair of Naples and the French in the Papal
States, of which, since I have seen Mack, I have no great
hopes, unless I can see to it myself, and for the fact that
it will set the Emperor in motion again. His sending, and
the Queen&rsquo;s acceptance of Mack, should be a pledge of this.
The Queen&rsquo;s army cannot move till November, which will
give me time and plenty to summon Valetta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between it all I may get some action to clear my
atmosphere. If I stayed long in Naples, I feel as if I
should not be able to leave it. I have never lived till
now, but I must struggle against it, though goodness knows
why. Surely the Power which sent us into the world
meant us to make the best of our lives. Not the best in a
shore-parson&rsquo;s sense, but the best in the sense of extracting
the utmost cause for thankfulness out of life&mdash;the utmost
gratitude for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think I am a religious man, as men go. I do not
believe that there are many men who have a more active
sense of their duty to their country. I have never feared
to die for her in any of my hundred fights, and I always
lean upon my Maker before I go into them, and have ever
given Him the praise when I came safe out of them. But I
do not know how much I believe that what we do in this life
is to influence our happiness in a future life in a different
place, over going to which we have no control. I hope to
do my duty for the sake of what is my duty in this life,
and not as a bribe to secure happiness in the next. My
present position is that I tear myself away from that which
will give me the greatest happiness of which a man is
capable, and I do this out of submission to a code of whose
validity I am not sure. The code is of the West&mdash;Western;
but the traditions upon which it is founded are of the East&mdash;Eastern.
Those who made and keep the code regard those
who made and keep the traditions as barbarians. The
peoples upon whose traditions the convention is founded
have no such convention! Why, then, am I so concerned,
not about breaking the convention, of which I should never
dream, but about the misinterpretations of the Pharisees,
who have arrogated to themselves the maintenance of the
convention? I cannot tell. There is but one remedy for
it&mdash;the sea&mdash;which I have always proposed to myself as
my bride. I wonder if it was because I did not know what
the possibilities of life were?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII.</span>&mdash;Which the
Idle Reader may skip, as Politics.
It sets forth the Cowardice
and unravels the Intrigues which
led to the Fall of Naples.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE situation of affairs can best be inferred from
certain brief entries in the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>5th Nov.</i>&mdash;Back at Naples. I pray God I
may be right about this matter. One cannot be certain of
things where one has not Englishmen to carry them out.
But I love Italy so dearly, that I feel that surgical remedies
must be used to cut out that ulcer in the place from which
Rome, the mother of practical civilisation, once sent forth
her humanising influences all over the known world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a place is Italy! Every spot, almost every
building left as it was when its great deeds were done
in it, hundreds and thousands of years ago. Nothing but
the earthquake, the volcano, and the Popes forestall time
in obliterating the footsteps of history here. I am told
that they still have the gate at Rome in which Camillus,
going forth to exile, paused to wish that Rome might never
have need to recall him. That was the spirit of the men
whose monuments surround us; but the spirit of the vile
brood of Frenchmen, whose presence is a hornet&rsquo;s nest to
Italy, is to burn away, to wash away in blood, to trample
away with coarse feet, every trace that any man had a
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>7th Nov.</i>&mdash;I am, I fear, drawn into a promise that
Naples Bay shall never be left without an English man-of-war.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
I never intended leaving <em>the coast</em> of Naples without
one. If I had, who could withstand the request of such
a Queen? Leghorn must be speedily attended to. The
Grand Duke, I fancy, begins to see <em>fear</em>: the King goes
to the army to-morrow. In three days he hopes to march.
His Majesty is determined to conquer or die at the head
of his army, which is composed of thirty thousand healthy,
good-looking troops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have had a letter from Louis, enclosing a petition from
the ship&rsquo;s company of the <i>Minotaur</i>, and endorsing their
request. Hang every mutineer! say I; and hanging&rsquo;s too
good for &rsquo;em. A mutineer is a traitor, and the whole lot
are poison. The man who lets his mercy get the better
of his judgment in such a matter is disloyal to his country,
and I hope I shall always have the faithfulness to string
them up with a short shrift. But I cannot well refuse
Louis, for I can never forget his noble and effectual support
to my flag on the most glorious 1st of August. A friend
in need is a friend indeed: never was it better applied
than to the <i>Minotaur</i>. I must write this to Louis, and also
write him a letter to read to his ship&rsquo;s company, saying
that it is in remembrance of his support, and of the gallant
conduct of the <i>Minotaur&rsquo;s</i> ship&rsquo;s company, etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>13th Nov.&mdash;Camp, St. Germaines.</i>&mdash;A desire from His
Majesty called me here yesterday to concert with General
Acton the commencement of the war. Thirty thousand of
Mack&rsquo;s <i>la plus belle arm&eacute;e d&rsquo;Europe</i> was drawn out for me
to see; and, as far as my judgment goes in these matters,
I agree that a finer army cannot be. In the evening we
had a Council, and it was settled that four thousand infantry
and six hundred cavalry should take possession of Leghorn.
Their destination they are to believe is Malta, and it is
entrusted to me to undeceive them when we are out at
sea. Mack is to march, I repeat it with pleasure, with
thirty thousand of the finest troops in Europe, on Saturday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
the 17th to Rome, and keep advancing, trusting to the
support of the Emperor. Every hour the French are
increasing their Italian army, and two new generals are
arrived at Rome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus I went to bed last night, and at six this morning
came to take leave of their Majesties. I found them in
great distress. The courier who left London on the 4th
has not brought any assurance of support from the
Emperor. M. Thugut is evasive, and wishes, he says, the
French to be the aggressors. Is it not aggression, if this
Court knows, all the world knows, that the French are
collecting an army to overrun Naples; in a week destroy
the monarchy, plunder and make it a Republic? As this
is fully known, surely it is aggression of the most serious
nature. The Emperor&rsquo;s troops have not yet been in the
habit of retaking kingdoms, and it is easier to destroy than
to restore. I ventured to tell their Majesties that one of
the following things must happen to the King, and he had
his choice&mdash;&lsquo;either to advance, trusting to God for His
blessing on a just Cause, to die with <i>l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e &agrave; la main</i>, or
remain quiet and be kicked out of your kingdoms.&rsquo; The
King replied he would go on, and trust in God, and desired
me to stay till noon to consult with Mack on this new face
of affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>15th Nov.</i>&mdash;Their Majesties have now informed me that
things stand precisely as they did before the receipt of
despatches from London and Vienna; but it is evidently a
blow their not getting money from England. The Ministers
do not know how to get it: their paper money is at 40 per
cent. discount. I long ago told the Queen I did not think Mr.
Pitt would go to Parliament and ask money of the country;
that if England saw every exertion made in this country to
save themselves, John Bull was never backward in supporting
friends in distress. Good God! my Lord, can the
Emperor submit to this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>16th Nov.</i>&mdash;I must tell De Niza to have his squadron
ready by Saturday, and if all cannot be got ready I must be
informed by Thursday evening how many can be ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>17th Nov.</i>&mdash;Even the Grand Signor has condescended
to notice my earnest endeavours to serve the cause of
humanity against a set of impious men. I must write and
tell his Admiral how anxious I am for the success of the
Ottoman arms, and how happy he can make me by telling
me how I can be most useful to him. Must also embrace the
opportunity of paying my respects to the Russian Admiral,
and assuring him how happy I feel that we are so near
each other, and working together for the good cause of our
sovereigns. If this continues so, I shall indeed be happy,
because I have suspected the Russians, whose distance
relieves them from the fear of French aggression, of playing
for their own hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Memo.</i>&mdash;Have ordered his Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s ships <i>Lion</i>
and <i>Aretusa</i> to proceed to Malta and put themselves under
Captain Ball. For this blockade numbers will do. Of all
the fleets in my command only the English can be relied
on <em>when the game is afoot</em>. Every Portuguese and Sicilian
ship has some if not every fault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>18th November.</i>&mdash;Last evening dear Emma came in,
looking inexpressibly engaging: she evidently had something
on her mind which gave her a girlish diffidence.
With her little straight nose and delicately cut chin, I don&rsquo;t
see how she is ever to look anything but girlish; and last
night she had simple white flowers&mdash;real flowers twined in
a sort of chaplet in her beautiful hair; and her exquisite
neck and bosom, without a single jewel, were shown up
by a bodice of soft primrose-coloured lawn, as simple as a
thrown-back mantilla. She came up to me with an air of
pretty coaxing, made the prettier by a conviction that it
would fail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross with me, Nelson,&rsquo; she begged. &lsquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
know you will be vexed, but I&rsquo;m sure the Queen meant
you to see it.&rsquo; And then she showed me a letter from the
Queen, full of the idea that money was indispensable,
which was evidently intended for my eyes. I was to tell
Mr. Pitt, I suppose, what I saw. That I can do very soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see the finest country in the world full of resources, yet
not enough to supply the public wants; all are plundering
who can get at public money or stores. In my own line I
can speak. A Neapolitan ship of the line would cost more
than ten English ships fitting out. Five sail of the line
must ruin the country. Everything else is, I have no
doubt, going on in the same system of thieving. I could
give Mr. Pitt so many instances of the greatest mal-content
of persons in office, and of those very people being rewarded.
If money could be placed in the Public Chest at this
moment, I believe it would be well used; for the sad
thing in this country is, that, although much is raised, yet
very little reaches the Public Chest. I will give you a
fact: when the Order of Jesuits was suppressed in this
country and Sicily, they possessed very large estates.
Although these, with every other part of their property,
were seized by the Crown, yet, to this moment, not one
farthing has reached the Public Chest. On the contrary,
some years the pretended expense of management was
more than the produce. Taxes have been sold for sums of
money, which now are five times more than when sold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told all this to Emma; to which she replied that she
knew it better than I, but as it had been in the beginning
in Italy, so it was now, and ever should be. To which I
replied, like a great brute&mdash;though I could see she was not
far from crying, and scolded myself half the night for my
roughness to her&mdash;&lsquo;That it would all have to end, and that
it would be fortunate if the Kingdom did not end first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>21st November.</i>&mdash;Have wrote to my brother, the
Reverend Mr. Nelson, of Hillborough, to tell him how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
earnestly I pray that the victory of which it has pleased
God to make me a principal may be useful to my family.
As to myself, the probability is that I shall never take my
seat in the House of Peers. My health has declined very
much, and nothing keeps me on service but the thought
that I am doing good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; 22nd November.</i>&mdash;Ordered Commodore
Stone, of Her Faithful Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Rainha</i>, to remain at
this place, and to keep his ship complete with provisions
and water, to put to sea at a moment&rsquo;s warning; and, in
case of any unforeseen accident, to follow the direction of
Sir William Hamilton, and embark the families and effects
of the English and Portuguese, if necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; at Sea, Nov. 27th.</i>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know when I
have been so low; though, thank God, I have not felt the
sea-sickness much, in spite of the gale, which has been very
bad. The hope of action keeps me up. The General will,
I trust, have news of the Emperor which will make him
act firmly. War once declared, I shall destroy all the
privateers which have been gathering in Leghorn as a
neutral port&mdash;I daresay as many as a hundred of them. The
British ships are, I think, all right, though the weather is
so thick that we cannot make any out; but I have no hope
of the Portuguese having followed us in such weather. I
do hope there will be some action, for the past five days
here have been very heavy on my spirits: the weather has
been so infernal that we shall be six days making Leghorn
from Naples; and the contrast between my beautiful
chamber in Sir William&rsquo;s palace, overlooking the Bay of
Naples, and my cabin with a gale of wind blowing, cannot
be described. It is not the cabin, it is not the gale&mdash;I do
not mind them: I have been through it all, and worse,
before&mdash;but it is the loneliness. Instead of the very finest
of society, the witty, well-informed Sir William, most
admirable of hosts, and my beautiful Lady with her laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
eyes and caressing smile, there being no English of my
rank on board, I have only my own company or the
General&rsquo;s&mdash;Naselli&rsquo;s. We can, fortunately, neither of us
talk the other&rsquo;s language, or I fear I should have more of
his company, and I have an instinctive aversion to him.
He was intended for a Chamberlain and to die of apoplexy.
I shall write to Emma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Later.</i>&mdash;I have written to dear Emma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Lady Hamilton</span>,&mdash;How I miss you and the good
Sir William, who, with my father and my good wife, are my only
comforts in life, now that I cannot have the ships I want, or even
the authority from their Majesties, to finish with these French!
How shall I ever thank you and Sir W. for all your goodness
to me? You have been so wonderfully hospitable; and for you
yourself, you kept me alive. You gave me health, and such a
friendship as I had not dreamed was possible in the world. How
I miss that gentle voice; the soothing touch of those hands; the
friendly glance of those clear eyes; the laughter lurking about the
corners of that mouth, which it is difficult for any man to take
his eyes off! But dear Sir William will be jealous, if that good
man were capable of misunderstanding an upright man&rsquo;s esteem
for his Lady, and were not aware that&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; Leghorn, 28th Nov.</i>&mdash;Came on board the
British and Neapolitan Ministers, who were saluted. Summoned
the town of Leghorn in concert with the Neapolitan
General Naselli. At 8 p.m. the Governor consented to give
up the place. Landed the troops, cannon, baggage, etc., with
all expedition, and took possession. It blew a strong gale
on the night of the 22nd, when we sailed from Naples, and
the next day. None but the British ships kept me company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
&ldquo;There seems to be some tangle with the Grand Duke.
Have begged our Minister Wyndham to say that I would
willingly adopt the mode of procedure most agreeable to
him; but the Neapolitan general&mdash;d&mdash;n his impudence!&mdash;only
looks upon me as an agent for transporting him. He
sends <em>his</em> Summons as he pleases. I shall rejoice to see
Wyndham, who reports the capture of Port Mahon by my
friend Stuart, and Commodore Duckworth afloat. Leghorn
does not, at this moment, receive me on shore. I am
anxious to get to the support of the King of Naples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>29th Nov., &lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; Leghorn Roads.</i>&mdash;Is it war or
is it not war? These confounded Sicilians and Tuscans
think themselves at liberty to create an artificial state of
<em>not-war</em>, which they can plead to the French when they
get beaten, as they certainly will be, if they attempt to
make war in such a way. Much good it will do them,
though! If the French had common gratitude, it might,
for all their precautions are in the direction of disobliging
us, and we are the only enemy the French have to reckon
with in the world, it seems to me. Have signified to the King
of the Two Sicilies and the Grand Duke of Tuscany, that
the Ports of Genoa (the Ligurian Republic forsooth!) are
in a state of blockade, and that should any vessel of either
of these nations presume after this notice to attempt
entering this port, I have ordered Troubridge, whom I
have put in charge, to sink or burn them with their
cargoes. Either of them would carry ammunition for the
French to fight against their own country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have writ to Lord Spencer to-day&mdash;I fear too hastily.
It would certainly break things up here if I did not feel
confident in his lordship not to expose me if I occasionally
write too freely of what I see and know. I am so much
in the habit of writing my mind freely, that I cannot say
what I wish in a stiff formal letter. Under this impression
I have said that the Portuguese squadron are totally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
useless. The Marquis de Niza has certainly every good
disposition to act well; but he is completely ignorant of
<em>Sea</em> affairs. I expect to hear they have had all disasters,
and that they are returned to Naples. All their Commanders
are Commodores, <em>and it is ridiculous to hear them
talk of their rank</em>, and of the impossibility of serving under
any of my brave and good Captains. Yet these men are
English. I say Niza is by far the best among them, and
I shall keep up a good harmony with him. As to the
port being neutral, that is impossible; and if the Neapolitan
General does not consider it as I do, I will directly have
orders sent him to that effect. General Acton and the
Queen will instantly see the propriety of the measure.
To-morrow I return in the <i>Vanguard</i> to Naples. I will be
active as long as I can, but my strength fails me daily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very low to-day till I had, through Wyndham,
a surprise so delightful that it was difficult to preserve
the diplomatic calm which was already pretty well tried
by that weathercock Naselli&mdash;no less than a letter from
Emma, passed overland with incredible rapidity from
shepherd to shepherd. I am not ashamed to say that
I kissed it when I had read it. It was like her dear hands
pressing on my forehead when I have one of my vile
headaches. Why should there be such things as headaches,
to incapacitate a man from work? Though, thank Heaven,
when there is real work to be done like fighting, the
excitement breeds a rush of vigour which carries everything
before it. I have copied every word of that dear letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Naples</span>, <i>Nov. 22nd, 1798</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear good Admiral</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As this goes overland and through not over-safe
hands, I can but send you by it expressions of our esteem and
of the wilderness you have left in our little family. Sir William
he do miss you terribly, being accustomed to your gayety and
also to lean on your supperior judgement. For a woman it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
worse by much, for no good woman but is sensible of a kind
of support, a kind of holy joy in the presence of the man that
she feels to be the greatest man there is, as I feel about you,
dearest Nelson, greatest hero of the ancient and modern world.
I would I was with you now, for I know how ill and distressed
you must be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The gale has been awfull. The Portuguese is not out
yet, nor like to be. They are not like my Nelson, but fine-weather
sailors that must be protected by a port, and a fort if
there is any enemy near. And you have all the anxiety, which
I know you detest, of waiting for others to move, as the good
Emperor must, when he hears of the sacrifice we have been
making to send so fine an army, from which, by this, I believe,
the French will be in full flight. I know how your head will
be splitting from the wound you got in the service of your
country in your glorious victory; and Emma would like to be
with you, laying her hands, which you say are so smooth and
full of vittality, on the poor wounded forehead and also on
the topp of your head, when the blood is throbbing there. It
gives her such joy to think that you like her to be with you,
even when you are too ill to raise your head; she can be quiet,
indeed she can, and wait until her presence can save you the
slightest effort which would make fresh pains in your head.
But what pleases me most is that when the badd pains is gone
and you suffer from a nervousness that they should return,
Emma is able, with scarce observed kisses and gentle wiles, to
draw you out of yourself, so that you forgett you are playing hide
and seek with the head-ache. I have what is worse, the heart-ache.
There is no cure for that but time. You know how I
was sick for Greville, that I had lived with as his wife, in the first
months that I was at Napoli with dear Sir William. Often have
I thought that I was dying of a broken heart; only hearts don&rsquo;t
break, dear Nelson, though you believe that they do, if I may
say Nay to so great a man. Every night I wept myself to sleep
when I slept at all, and if it had not been for Sir William&rsquo;s
goodness&mdash;he was like a father to a dying child, and cheated me
out of the death for which I so longed by humouring me. I
tell you I was a good wife to Greville, Nelson, though I was
never married to him as I have been to Sir William. I had not
another earthly thought except to be with him and be his slave
to do his slightest wish. Had he beaten me I would have stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
to be beaten, not even trying to escape the blows. I think even
they would have been dear to me, because he had given them
to me. I was but a girl, and loved a man to be master of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should be wrong if I told you that I feel your absence as I
felt my absence from Greville then. But that is the kind of way
I feel it, though I have never known your love. I am a fool,
Nelson, I know I am; but I am also a loving woman, that can
see all the goodnesses there is in the man her eyes are following,
and fall down and worship each of them. It is the second
commandment that I should break: &ldquo;Thou shalt not make to
thyself any graven image&rdquo;&mdash;for this, I suppose, means that you
shall not make an idol of anything, and that is what I cannot
but do. Come back to Napoli soon, to your loving <span class="smcap">Emma</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;And immediately below this was added, in the Ambassador&rsquo;s
easily recognisable hand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake come back soon. My hero-worshipping
Emma has the moping-sickness, and I cannot afford to have her
<i>hors de combat</i> at this anxious time.&mdash;W.&nbsp;H.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;And to this dear Emma added a second post-scriptum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here in Naples we are very busy making preparations to
celebrate the King&rsquo;s glorious return. The great idea for illuminations
is the asphodel flower with three heads of flowers
made of little lights, and hanging from them the letters F.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;N.&mdash;Ferdinand,
Nelson, Mack. They are also making a figure of
France with a red cap, rolling in the dust by the cut-down tree
of Anarchy, for the King to put his foot on her neck at the
grand gala.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Nov. 30th, &lsquo;Vanguard.&rsquo;</i>&mdash;I have been thinking all
night of the General and Duke of Sangro&rsquo;s saying, that the
King of Naples had not declared War against the French.
Now, I assert that he has, and in a much stronger manner
than the ablest Minister in Europe could write a Declaration
of War. Has not the King received, as a conquest made by
him, the Republican flag taken at Gozo? Is not the King&rsquo;s
flag flying there and at Malta&mdash;and at Malta not only by
the King&rsquo;s absolute permission, but by his orders? Is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
the flag shot at every day by the French, and returned
from batteries bearing the King&rsquo;s flag? And are not two
frigates and a corvette placed under my orders? and they
would fight the French, meet them where they may. Has
not the King sent publicly from Naples guns, mortars, &amp;c.,
with officers and artillery, to fight against the French in
Malta? If those acts are not tantamount to any written
paper, I give up all knowledge of what is War. So far,
then, I assert that the General is authorised to seize all
French and Ligurian vessels. But that is a small matter
to what will happen, if he permits the many hundreds of
French which are now in the Mole, to be neutral till they
have a fair opportunity of being active. Even the interest
of the Great Duke calls loudly that the Neapolitan General
should act with vigour, for if all other schemes fail, they
have one sure&mdash;viz., set one vessel on fire, and the Port of
Leghorn is ruined for twenty years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Vanguard,&rsquo; 1st Dec.</i>&mdash;These French and Genoese
privateers laying in the Mole are the very mischief. Some
of the former are of such force as to be practically war-vessels,
and there are above seventy of the latter ready to
sail loaded with corn for Genoa and France. The Neapolitan
General refuses to seize them, under this same
sickening pretence. Have written to Sir William, to demand
that orders should instantly be sent to the General
for the seizure of every French vessel. The old fool!
Still that playing to the French at the expense of British
commerce&mdash;a ladder of the weak sitting on the wall between
two minds, which the strong will kick away, when the
minute arrives. Genoa is equally at war with Great
Britain as the French, for I consider the self-named
Ligurian Republic as at present only a Province of France.
Even the Neapolitan Government should see that to permit
the departure of this corn from Leghorn must expedite the
entrance into Italy of more French troops. I have got the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
old fool to lay an embargo on all vessels, till he receives
the orders of his Court. He sees, I believe, the permitting
these vessels to depart in the same light as myself; but
there is this difference between us,&mdash;the General prudently,
and certainly safely, awaits the orders of his Court, taking
no responsibility on himself; I act, from the circumstance
of the moment, as I feel it may be most advantageous for
the honour of the Cause which I serve, taking all responsibility
on myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, 5th Dec.</i>&mdash;Met the Portuguese on my way back.
I expect dear Hood every moment from Egypt. His
provisions must be very short. He deserves great credit
for his perseverance. I hope the good Turk will have
relieved him; but the Russians seem to me more intent
on taking ports in the Mediterranean than on destroying
Buonaparte in Egypt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am still worried over that <i>Culloden</i> matter. I received
yesterday a private letter from Lord Spencer, of October 7th,
saying that the First Lieutenants of all the ships engaged
would be promoted. I sincerely hope this is not intended
to exclude the first of the <i>Culloden</i>: I must write to Lord S.
for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, for my sake, if it is so, to get it altered.
Our dear friend, Troubridge, has suffered enough; and
no one knows from me but that the <i>Culloden</i> was as much
engaged as any ship in the Squadron. His sufferings were
in every respect more than any of us. He deserves every
reward which a grateful country can bestow on the most
meritorious sea-officer of his standing in the Service. I
have felt his worth every hour of my command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 5th</i> (<i>later</i>).&mdash;Am back in Naples in my home.
I cannot but regard it as my home; for here I have met
with the most complete rest and happiness which I have
known in my lifetime, spent in loneliness on the sea for the
best part of thirty years. Her Majesty and Sir William
and dear Emma met me on the steps of the little port they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
call the Arsenal. They seemed mightily glad to have me
returned: Her Majesty saying that she should now feel
safe whatever fortune befel her arms; and Sir William,
that his house had been like a monastery since I sailed
to Leghorn. While Emma said nothing, but laughed and
cried a little, and poured out the gladness of her heart
in looks and smiles, till we got to the palace, where Sir
William said kindly: &lsquo;Kiss her mopes away, and see if
you cannot get me back my merry Emma,&mdash;she has been
sick for the sight of you. Only I know what an affectionate
heart it is, that feels as if something had been torn out of
it by the roots, when it is deprived of the sight of one it
loves.&rsquo; And, thus adjured, she came to me and wept silently
on my shoulder; and then, giving me a happy kiss, went
back to her husband and got into his arm, and said in
the prettiest way in the world, &lsquo;I am sorry to have been
such a moper, and you are the best husband alive, and I
will be good now.&rsquo; Adding, with a flash of mischief from
the laughing eyes&mdash;&lsquo;Now that I have the moon back that I
cried for.&rsquo; And he held his arm around her with the affection,
as it seemed to me, of a father rather than a husband,
and looked down on her with the fondest pride. But he
did not kiss her; he treated her rather as a favourite child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dec. 6th.</i>&mdash;The state of this country is briefly this: the
army is at Rome, Civita Vecchia taken, but in the Castle of
St. Angelo are 500 French troops. The French have 13,000
troops at a strong post in the Roman State, called Castellana.
General Mack is gone against them with 20,000; the event
in my opinion is doubtful, and on it hangs the immediate
fate of Naples. If Mack is defeated, this country, in fourteen
days, is lost; for the Emperor has not yet moved his army,
and if the Emperor will not march, this country has not the
power of resisting the French. But it was not a case of
choice, but necessity, which forced the King of Naples to
march out of his country, and not to wait till the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
had collected a force sufficient to drive him, in a week, out
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have wrote to Commander Duckworth to congratulate
him on the conquest of Minorca&mdash;an acquisition invaluable
to Great Britain, and completely in future prevents any
movements from Toulon to the westward. My situation
in this country has had doubtless <em>one</em> rose plucked from
a bed of thorns. Nor is my present state that of ease;
and my health, at best but indifferent, has not mended
lately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the new war in which Naples has just embarked,
the event God only knows; but, without the assistance of
the Emperor, which is not yet given, this country cannot
resist the power of France. Leghorn is in possession with
the King of Naples&rsquo; troops, as is Civita Vecchia. I have
Troubridge, <i>Minataur</i>, <i>Terpsichore</i>, and <i>Bon Citoyenne</i> on
the north coast of Italy, three sail of the line under Ball off
Malta; and Hood with three sail of the line and two frigates
is in Egypt, but I expect his return every moment, and
that the Turks and Russian ships and flotilla have relieved
him. I am here <i>solus</i>, for I reckon the Portuguese as
nothing. They are all flag officers, and cannot serve under
any of my brave friends. I wish I could get letters to
St. Vincent: it is important to him to know our state here.
The new war commenced here is yet impossible to say how
it may turn&mdash;whether it really hastens the ruin, or saves
the monarchy. At all events, if the King had not begun
the war he would soon have been kicked out of his kingdom.
Mack has with him twenty thousand fine young men, but
with some few exceptions wretchedly officered. If the
French are not soon driven from their post, which is very
strong by nature, Mack must fall back to the frontier on the
side of Ancona. The French have drove back, to say no
worse, the right wing of the King&rsquo;s army, and taken all
their baggage and artillery. The Emperor has not yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
moved, and his Minister, Thugut, is not very anxious to
begin a new war; but if he does not, Naples and Tuscany
will fall in two months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dec. 7th.</i>&mdash;On my arrival here from Leghorn I received
a letter from Lord Spencer, communicating to me the
title His Majesty had been generously pleased to confer on
me. An honour, his lordship was pleased to add, the
highest that has ever been conferred on an officer of my
standing, who is not a Commander-in-chief. It should have
been a Viscount at the least. I am not, I hope, a vain man,
but this is due to the fine fellows who won my victory. It
goes to show that the granting of honours is geographical:
now, if it had been at the mouth of the Thames and not
at the Nile, I should be by this a Duke, judging by the
scale of recent rewards. The suspense of men&rsquo;s minds
would have been so awful until the thing was settled that
ministers would have been carried away by the pressure.
It would be good for the Service if ministers were carried
away sometimes. Greater recognition could not be given
to the victory of my fleet, <em>because I was not a Commander-in-chief</em>.
As if this made things easier. They cannot be
insensible to the difficulties I have to encounter in not being
a Commander-in-chief; indeed, with any other Commander-in-chief
except my dear old friend, Lord St. Vincent, I
should never have got to the Nile at all, much less conquered
the French. Himself what is called a Conservative officer,
there never was a more generous chief to officers detailed for
particular duties. He not only gave me ten more ships, but
his ten best ships; and so he does for all. God knows the
strain it all was, and the bitter moment of my return to
Syracuse! The only happy moment I felt was in the view
of the French. Then I knew that all my sufferings would
soon be at an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And concerning this matter of the <i>Culloden</i>, I hope and
believe the word &lsquo;engaged&rsquo; is not intended to exclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
her. I hope that the merit of that ship and her gallant
Captain are too well known to benefit by anything I
could say. Her misfortune was great in getting aground,
while her more fortunate companions were in the full tide
of happiness. No; I am confident that my good Lord
Spencer will never add misery to misfortune. Indeed, no
person has a right to know that the <i>Culloden</i> was not as
warmly engaged as any ship in the Squadron. Captain
Troubridge on shore is superior to other captains afloat.
In the midst of his great misfortunes he made those signals
which prevented certainly the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Swiftsure</i> from
running on the Shoal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have written to Lord Spencer about it&mdash;I begged
his pardon for writing on the subject, because I verily
believe that it has never entered his Lordship&rsquo;s head;
but my heart, as it ought to be, is warmed to my gallant
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, Dec. 8th.</i>&mdash;We are quit of <i>La Combe de St.
Michel</i>, the Minister of the French Republic at the Court
of the Two Sicilies, suite and baggage. I had the greatest
pleasure in the world in giving the Genoese Pink <i>La
Madonna di Parto Salvo</i>, Argita Ferraii, Master, which had
him aboard, a pass from the Bay of Naples to the Port of
Genoa, which desired His Majesty&rsquo;s Ships, and any private
vessel belonging to the English nation, to afford him every
assistance and facilitate his passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, Dec. 9th.</i>&mdash;It is tails, not heads. It is reported,
and indeed is certain, that the Neapolitan officers are run
away even at the sight of the enemy. As must ever be
the case, several brave officers have fallen. I know not
the extent of the disaster, but I believe it is very bad.
Have written to Troubridge to keep something very often
at Leghorn, for I think it very probable that I may be
forced to send for him in a hurry; and I have warned him
that everything he sends here must anchor cautiously <em>if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
my Flag is not here</em>. What orders have been sent to
General Naselli I know not. It was determined to order
him to seize all French and Ligurian vessels in the Mole.
This Emma got from Her Majesty, who is the only man
in her kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing it is that nothing is to
be done here save through a beautiful young woman, and
her of another nation!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, whenever I enter My Lady&rsquo;s boudoir, of
intelligent sympathy and co-operation. Those clear eyes
see deeper than most into the tangles of politics (which
mean intrigues here), and that graceful head has a woman&rsquo;s
wit in divining the course of things. But it is the courage
of the noble creature that overwhelms me. Neither army
nor mob could daunt her from fighting for a friend as a
tigress will fight for her cubs; and, what is finer, she is
equally dauntless of responsibility. Had Emma been a
sea-captain, she would have been as daring as Foley at
the Nile. Heaven meant her to be a queen, but stayed
its hand and sent her to a country where there was a
Queen after her own heart, and to be the ambassador of
a greater country, for she is the ambassador of Great
Britain. Sir William is too much taken up with the set
of his eyeglass and the handling of his snuff-box. Sir
William is a Lord of the Admiralty spoiled. He would
have set them the finest example of allowing no national
peril or disaster to betray him into a loss of manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, too&mdash;I write this only because I know that what
I write thus shall never be seen of the public eye&mdash;he
has his great use, for his enemies look upon him as a fool
with whom the forms of respect have to be preserved, and
his wife as a beautiful adventuress&mdash;how I blush to write
these words!&mdash;whose lowly origin prevents her having to
be reckoned with. In this are they much mistaken, for
she can twist the Queen, who is in effect the King, round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
her little finger, and she has the wisdom as well as the
courage to save a kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her clear sight showed her at a glance that the vessels
in the Mole must be seized if we were to cut the French
off from their base, and she soon had the required order
from the Queen. But this sad history of the army may
have driven everything out of their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wyndham writes that it is settled that all the cargoes
of the Genoese ships should be landed, and all the French
privateers disarmed, and their crews sent away. So far I
am content. Money is not our object, but to distress the
common Enemy. I hope, if Troubridge liked it, he visited
the Grand Duke in my stead; I could not have been better
represented. The Copy is a d&mdash;d deal better than the
Original.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, 10th December.</i>&mdash;His Royal Highness, the Great
Duke, paid me the high honour of desiring to see me at
Pisa; but I was under a sacred promise to return here as
expeditiously as possible, and not to quit the Queen
and Royal Family of Naples without Her Majesty&rsquo;s approbation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the whole, I rejoiced to hear that the cargoes in the
Mole of Leghorn will be landed&mdash;though I fear that some of
it will find its way to the French&mdash;and the privateers
disarmed, and the scoundrels belonging to them sent away.
The Enemy will be distressed, and, thank God, I shall get
no money. The world, I know, thinks that money is our
God, and now they will be undeceived as far as relates to
us. &lsquo;Down, down with the French!&rsquo; is my constant
prayer. I hope that the Emperor is marched to support
this country; for, unused to war, <em>its officers seem alarmed
at a drawn sword, or a gun, if loaded with shot</em>. Many of
them, peaceable heroes, are said to have run away when
brought near the Enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have just got a hundred and fifty-nine of the <i>Leander&rsquo;s</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
from Corfu. It was dog&rsquo;s luck for Berry her falling in
with the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>, but I trust the King will confer the
same honours on him as if he had not been in the <i>Leander</i>;
indeed, his sufferings in her entitle him to more honours,
and the City of London has at any rate given him its
freedom. Her defence was glorious, and does Thompson
and Berry the highest credit. A French 50 would have
struck to one of our 74&rsquo;s without firing a gun. I shall
have that <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> yet, and that precious captain of hers,
unless he is by this time a prisoner to the Turks. I
daresay they will cut off his head, the scoundrel: the
treatment the officers received on board the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> was
infamous. They were plundered of everything they
possessed. Captain Thompson was even robbed of the
miniature of his mother, and at the very moment the
surgeon of the <i>Leander</i> was performing an operation he
was robbed of his instruments, and Captain Thompson
nearly lost his life by the attendance of his surgeon being
forcibly withheld. To the remonstrances of my officers
this Captain Lejoille coolly replied: &lsquo;<i>J&rsquo;en suis fach&eacute;, mais
le fait est que les Fran&ccedil;ois ne sont bons qu&rsquo;au pillage</i>.&rsquo; Berry
has asked me if Josiah is yet made Post. I do not see any
probability of that event. He asks Campbell to get him
a fan-mount. I shall see to it myself, and wish he had a
thought of anything else. He shall have the sword which
he brought me off the <i>Spartiate</i> when she struck. I
shall never forget his support for my mind on the 1st
of August.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that Malta will fall in due time. I think the
Order will never be restored: the inhabitants hate them.
The delayed war on the part of the Emperor will be the
destruction of this Monarchy, and, of course, to the new-acquired
dominions of the Emperor in Italy. Had the war
commenced in September or October, all Italy would at
this moment have been liberated. This month is worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
than the last; the next will render the contest doubtful,
and in six months, when the Neapolitan Republic will be
organised, armed, and with its numerous resources called
forth, I will suffer to have my head cut off if the Emperor
is not only defeated in Italy, but that he totters on his
throne at Vienna. Have wrote to the Empress that
notwithstanding the councils which have shook the throne
of her father and mother, I shall remain here, ready
to save the sacred persons of the King and Queen, and of
her brothers and sisters; and that I have also left ships
at Leghorn, to save the lives of the Great Duke and Her
Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s sister; for all must be a Republic, if
the Emperor does not act with expedition and vigour.
&lsquo;<em>Down, down</em> with the French!&rsquo; ought to be placed in the
Council-room of every country in the world, and may
Almighty God give right thoughts to every Sovereign, is
the constant prayer of one who only lives to defeat the
infamous machinations of these infidels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, 11th December.</i>&mdash;Not a line from England since
the 1st of October. Lord St. Vincent is in no hurry to oblige
me now; in short, I am the envied man, but better that
than to be the pitied one. Never mind; it is my present
intention to leave this country in May. The poor Queen
has again made me promise not to quit her or her family
until brighter prospects appear than do at present. The
King is with the Army, and she is sole Regent; she is, in
fact, a great King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Hamilton&rsquo;s goodness forces me out at noon for
an hour. What can I say of hers and Sir William&rsquo;s
attention to me? They are, in fact, with the exception
of my wife and my good father, the dearest friends I
have in this world. I live as Sir William&rsquo;s son in the
house, and my glory is as dear to them as their own; in
short, I am under such obligations as I can never repay
but with my eternal gratitude. The improvement made in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
Josiah by Lady Hamilton is wonderful; <em>Lady Nelson&rsquo;s
obligations and mine are infinite on that score; not but
Josiah&rsquo;s heart is as good and humane as ever was covered by
a human breast. God bless him!&mdash;I love him dearly with all
his roughness.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen has again made me promise not to quit
her and her family till brighter prospects open upon her.
She is miserable, we know. None from this house have
seen her these three days, but her letters to Emma paint
the anguish of her soul. However, on inquiry, matters
are not so bad as I expected. <em>The Neapolitan officers
have not lost much honour, for God knows they had but
little to lose</em>; but they lost all they had. Mack has supplicated
the King to sabre every man who ran from Civita
Castellana to Rome. He has, we hear, torn off the
epaulets of some of these scoundrels, and placed them
on good sergeants. I will, as briefly as I can, state the
position of the Army, and its lost honour, <em>for defeat they
have had none</em>. The right wing, of nineteen thousand men,
under General St. Philip and Michaux (who ran away at
Toulon), were to take post between Ancona and Rome, to
cut off all supplies and communication. Near Fermi they
fell in with the enemy, about three thousand. After a little
distant firing, St. Philip advanced to the French General,
and returning to his men said, &lsquo;I no longer command you,&rsquo;
and was going off to the Enemy. A sergeant said, &lsquo;You
are a traitor: what! have you been talking to the Enemy?&rsquo;
St. Philip replied, &lsquo;I no longer command you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then
you are an enemy!&rsquo; and, levelling his musket, shot St.
Philip through the right arm. However, the Enemy
advanced; he was amongst them. Michaux ran away, as
did all the Infantry, and had it not been for the good
conduct of two regiments of Cavalry, would have been
destroyed. So great was their panic, that cannon, tents,
baggage and military chest&mdash;all were left to the French.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
Could one credit, but it is true, that this loss has been
sustained with the death of only forty men? The French
lost many men by the Cavalry, and having got the good
things, did not run after an army three times their number.
Some ran thirty miles to Pesaro. The peasantry took up
arms&mdash;even the women&mdash;to defend their country. However,
the runaways are not only collected, but advanced to
Arcoti, which they took from the French, cutting open the
gates with hatchets. It is said they have got a good General&mdash;Cetto,
a Neapolitan Prince&mdash;and I hope will be ashamed
of their former conduct. General Michaux is bringing a
prisoner to Naples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This failure has thrown Mack backwards. It is the
intention of the General to surround Civita Castellana.
Chevalier de Saxe advanced to Viterbi, General Metch
to Fermi, and Mack with the main body, finding his
communication not open with Fermi, retreated towards
Civita Castellana. In his route he was attacked from an
intrenchment of the Enemy, which it was necessary to
carry. Finding his troops backward, he dismounted, and
attempted to rally them, but they left their General and
basely fled. The natural consequence was, he was sorely
wounded, but saved by some gallant Cavalry, and carried
off by the bravery of a coachman, and is safe, poor fellow,
at Rome, and hopes are entertained of his recovery. The
fugitives fled to Rome, fancying the French at their heels,
who never moved from their intrenchment, which was
carried by another part of the troops under General Dumas.
It is reported that the King has stripped the Prince di
Taranto, Duc di Trani, of his uniform, and disgraced him.
He commanded under Saxe, and fled amongst the first to
Rome. &rsquo;Tis for the traitorous and cowardly conduct of
these scoundrels that the great Queen is miserable, knowing
not who to trust. The French Minister and his Legation
went off by sea yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>Naples, 12th December.</i>&mdash;No squadron up to the 26th of
November arrived to relieve Captain Hood, who has long
been in want of being re-victualled and re-fitted; a frigate
and two or three gunboats are all that have arrived, when
certainly not less than three sail of the line, four frigates
with gun and mortar vessels, should have been sent.
Egypt is the first object&mdash;and Corfu the second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Neapolitan officers do not like fighting, and some
are traitors, so says report.</p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;The oddest thing in the midst of wars and alarms,
when a kingdom is tottering to its base. I was sitting in
my chamber&mdash;the one I had before, overlooking the Bay&mdash;writing
a despatch to Ball, whom I mistook so at first, and
have found to be a wonderful man since he has been at Malta,
when Emma, who is the best-hearted creature alive, came
in, more the coquette than I had ever known her. It may
have been only my imagination that she was dressed with
unwonted elegance. Certain I am that her clothes sat on
her uncommon well, and she was arching her brows&mdash;excelled
by no statue of antiquity in their perfect moulding.
Her eyes were brimful of mischief, and little smiles of
amusement were chasing each other round the lovely mouth,
that was doing its best to be grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Despatches,&rsquo; I said warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me write them for you, Lord Left-hand,&rsquo; she cried,
leaning on my shoulder caressingly to capture my pen and
read what I had written. This was all flat disobedience
of orders, and she was trying to coax me into forgetting
it. &lsquo;My dear Ball *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* With every kind wish to
Foley, Gould and Waller, believe me ever your affectionate
Nelson.&rsquo; &lsquo;Capital,&rsquo; she cried: &lsquo;is this Captain Gould of
the <i>Audacious</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then you have to be the Ambassador&mdash;or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
Ambassador&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and I am only going to be the Admiral
giving orders. You know our good Miss Knight?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her that wrote the new verse about me on to &ldquo;God
save the King&rdquo; at my birthday ball?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What of her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The very drollest thing has happened. It seems that
her father, who, as you know, was a most respectable
man&mdash;he died a Rear-Admiral and a Knight of the Bath, I
think&mdash;had a cousin living at Taunton, who was a chimney-sweep
or something of the kind. Well, he is dead too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good thing, I should think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Uncommon better than you think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Emma,&rsquo; I said, lifting my head to the rosy face
at my shoulder, in doing which I touched her soft cheek, &lsquo;I
think I never before heard you say an unkind thing, except
when your temper is blazing, which I do not count against
you. I had rather, I think, have kept my ideal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Was there ever such an unreasonable man, to begrudge
poor Miss Knight her good fortune?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What good fortune?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Five thousand golden guineas. The sweep has left
her his fortune, which, with what she has, will make her
between seven and eight thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And she has, I understand, for some time been receiving
advances from Captain Gould, of the <i>Audacious</i>, which she
is now in a position to gratify.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Knight must be over fifty,&rsquo; I said, half to myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is unkind now?&rsquo; asked Emma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I unkind? I was only thinking Gould is a young
man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was a diplomatist. She said nothing, so I
had to say something, and asked: &lsquo;And I am to be the
Ambassador who conveys&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The match-maker,&rsquo; she said softly, and then she
tripped away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I hope poor Miss Knight will get her
husband, but I fear I made a mess of it in striving to be
diplomatic, for I just wrote the news about the chimney-sweep,
adding: &lsquo;Lady Hamilton and Sir William desire to
be kindly remembered to all their good friends with you;
and Lady Hamilton and Miss Knight are not indifferent to
the welfare of those off Malta, particularly to an <i>Audacious</i>
and good friend of ours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma would have done better than this, but I tried to
be diplomatic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, Dec. 14th.</i>&mdash;This kingdom is invaded by a
formidable French army. Have sent word to Sir William,
for the information of the English merchants and others
residing at Naples, that the three English transports in this
Bay have my directions to receive such effects of the
English as they can stow, and that the whole squadron will
be ready to receive their persons should such an event be
found necessary for them to embark. Having had some
experience of this kind of thing, I have dropped him a hint
that I mean valuable effects, and not household furniture;
and that anything sent on board ship should be done
with as little bustle and as much secrecy as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must tell De Niza to lend the King a number of
Portuguese seamen and officers to assist in fitting some of
his ships for sea, or the French will have them. I think it
has come to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, Dec. 15th.</i>&mdash;The situation of this country is very
critical&mdash;nearly all in it are traitors or cowards. Have sent
for the <i>Goliath</i>, and ordered Foley to come through the
Faro of Messina, that he may get information. Have
cautioned him not to approach Naples but with great
caution. More bad luck: the <i>Flora</i> cutter is lost. Have
asked Ball if he can spare the <i>Incendiary</i>. I cannot use the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
Neapolitan ships: they are traitors in the <em>marine</em>. In short,
all is corrupt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>15th Dec.</i> (<i>later</i>).&mdash;Have sent for Troubridge, leaving the
<i>Terpsichore</i> in Leghorn Roads to bring off the Great Duke
should such a measure be necessary. I hope to God he
will make haste and approach the place with caution. The
King has returned here, and everything is as bad as possible.
If he does not come quickly he will find me at Messina or
even Palermo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dec. 16th.</i>&mdash;In the midst of all this, it is like a returning
ray of victory to receive from the powerful, formidable and
most magnificent Grand Signor his present in acknowledgment
of my success of 1st August&mdash;the <i>chelengk</i>, a kind of
diamond aigrette, and a sable fur with broad sleeves, with
two thousand sequins to be distributed among the wounded
of my crew. Have sent my dear son-in-law, Captain
Nisbet, to carry Kelim Effendi to Constantinople with my
thanks. The glory of the Ottoman arms is as dear to me
as those of my own country, and I always pray the God of
heaven and earth for His blessing on the Grand Signor and
all his faithful subjects. But I was in hopes that part of
the United Ottoman and Russian Squadron would have
gone to Egypt&mdash;the first object of the Ottoman arms&mdash;Corfu
is a secondary consideration. A squadron should
be sent, too, on the coast of St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre, which, if any
event drives us from the coast of Egypt, will be attacked by
sea. I have Buonaparte&rsquo;s letter before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first saw the French fleet, which for near
three months I had in vain sought, I prayed that if our
cause was just, I might be the happy instrument of His
punishment against unbelievers of the Supreme only True
God&mdash;that if it was unjust, I might be killed. The Almighty
took the battle into His own hand, and with His power
marked the victory as the most astonishing that ever was
gained at sea. All glory be to God. Amen! Amen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
&ldquo;Had a long and friendly conference with Kelim Effendi
on the conduct likely to be pursued by the Russian Court
towards the unsuspicious (I fear) and upright Turk. Our
ideas have exactly been the same about the Russians. A
strong squadron should have been sent to Egypt, to have
relieved my dear friend Captain Hood, but Corfu suited
Russia better. Enough ships were under the Admiral&rsquo;s
command for both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am now collecting a squadron to blockade Toulon,
where troops are embarked for Egypt. I had a right to
expect that the Turks and Russians would have taken care
of things east of Kandia. I could have seen to Corfu.
Troubridge was actually under sail when I heard that the
Russians were there. I have had the charge of the Two
Sicilies entrusted to me, and things have come to that
pitch that I do not know that the whole Royal Family, with
three thousand Neapolitan <i>emigr&eacute;s</i>, will not be under the
protection of the King&rsquo;s flag this night. Notwithstanding
the squadron I am sending to Egypt, at least two sail of the
line and four frigates should assemble at St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre;
for I know that is the place where Buonaparte has ordered
part of his fleet to go to if any accident should happen to
our squadron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, December 18th.</i>&mdash;There is an old saying that
&lsquo;when things are at the worst, they must mend.&rsquo; Now,
the mind of man cannot fancy things worse than they are
here. But, thank God, my health is better, my mind was
never firmer, and my heart is in the right trim to comfort,
relieve, and protect those who it is my duty to afford
assistance to. Whilst I live I will support the glory of
our Gracious Sovereign and that of our country, and if I
fall it shall be in a manner worthy of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Naples, December 19th.</i>&mdash;General Fortiguerra came here
yesterday, and said that he had been with the King, and
was desired by the King to fit out all his Navy in the port,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
and requested that I would allow some of the Portuguese
seamen to be lent, in order to fit them out, as they understood
Italian, and I understood that he was to prepare for
the King&rsquo;s departure; and to the last my reply was, that
I could receive no orders from any but the King, but that
His Majesty had not a more faithful subject than myself in
his dominions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dec. 19th</i> (<i>later</i>).&mdash;Have had sail-makers making cots
for the Royal Family, and painters painting the ward-room
and offices under the poop. Have been getting ready for
sea, and in the night time getting off the valuable effects of
Her Sicilian Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see no help for it but Palermo, and shall make my
dispositions. Dear Emma, who has the heart of a lion
and the instinct of an admiral, was in here just now (I
have judged to make my quarters at the Embassy as usual:
any personal risk is far outbalanced by the confidence it
inspires), and sees nothing else for it. She knows the
Neapolitans, and does not value them but for hole-and-corner
defence. When it comes to artillery they are
nowhere, and Championnet brings guns! What a woman!
She has been laying her preparations for a week, or two
weeks past, and whenever it is necessary we shall take
the Royal Family and treasure, I hear to the extent of two
millions and a half, without ado. It only remains to save
the ships, which it is doubtful if the Neapolitan marine
wishes to save from the French. Naples will look after
itself: it has quite enough traitors in it to make peace with
any enemy. With the Court faction (some three thousand,
including foreigners) embarked, no one would be hurt if
the <i>lazzaroni</i> could keep quiet. But they hate the French,
and they have a turbulence and adventurousness of spirit
which comes very near great bravery; though they are
hardly brave, for in the open with fair play they would not
stand. Small bodies of Frenchmen will be cut off until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
the <i>lazzaroni</i> have been slaughtered in sufficient numbers
for a lesson, and if I know anything of the French the
lesson will be a severe one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Emma, in the midst of all this turmoil and labour&mdash;for
it is the labour of Hercules to do so much and not
appear to be doing&mdash;she contrives to be just as affectionate
and thoughtful as when we landed three months ago and
there was not a cloud upon the horizon. Whenever I am
disengaged, she contrives to be with me: she has so great
a fear of being inhospitable to one who on any reasoning
must soon sail. I do not find myself so afraid of her now....
No! I was never afraid of Emma&mdash;I was afraid of myself.
Needlessly, I think. I should have known that such a
steady flame of friendship will not set fire or consume.
She has been like a mother to Josiah, and she has been
like a mother to me, though so much younger. She says
that all sailors are children&mdash;God&rsquo;s children: not meaning
by this that they are godly, though the roughest sailor is
by nature of his calling apt to keep some notion of a Deity
in his heart; but because God keeps them in some respects
in a state of childhood, being so much cut off from the
world in which others are offered the fruit of the tree of
knowledge. She says to me, &lsquo;You are a great conqueror,
and yet you are a child, and I must take care of you.&rsquo;
She says that she was wrote to when I first came to Naples,
to take care of me from the ladies, which indeed she has
done; so that, though there are some very beautiful young
women among the English residents as well as at the Court,
I am not in the train of any of them, but have been a stay-at-home
when there were not public ceremonies. I am not
afraid of myself now,&mdash;I know the quality of her affection.
And if sometimes she is carried away by enthusiasm, I
know that it is but the homage of a generous heart to a
wounded man&mdash;who has won a victory. And I take it in
the spirit in which it is offered.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII.</span>&mdash;How the
Neapolitans declared War, and
how they waged it.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME Roman remarked of something, <i>Fuit</i>, which
means &ldquo;it has been,&rdquo; and that correctly described
the Kingdom of Naples at the time of which I am
writing. The Admiral was grievously disappointed; the
mischief came of the fact, so I have heard him say, that
none of the people principally responsible for the movement
were natives of the kingdom with whose forces they
were acting. This does not, as he remarked, signify so
much when the war is being carried on with money and
mercenaries; but when a kingdom has to rely on an army
which is no army in a Great Power&rsquo;s sense of the word,
and has no money to pay it, the result is deplorable. For
carrying out the operations in which the Admiral delighted,
such as his celebrated movement inside the French line at
our great battle&mdash;an advantage snatched by discipline and
daring from the teeth of destruction&mdash;Neapolitans are worse
than useless, for they are braggarts and traitors, as well as
cowards, and therefore one makes a mistake in employing
them. Qualities of enduring fatigue and hardship, and
managing to subsist upon a minimum of food and money,
they have in a high degree, as they afterwards showed
when they had no army to speak of, and no general, and
no campaign, but were a nation in arms resisting an
invader whose presence was always marked by rapine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
The persons principally responsible for the ill-starred campaign
to extirpate the French from Papal territory were
a pair of Austrians&mdash;the Queen and her fine general, Mack;
and three English&mdash;the Admiral, my Lady, and Sir John
Acton. The root of it all was the Queen, who was in
reality the King of the Two Sicilies. She, as the physicians
say, had diagnosed the evil correctly; and because
her diagnosis agreed with the Admiral&rsquo;s, he had thrown
his great influence into the scale to impress her very
sensible views upon the Emperor, who was her nephew
and son-in-law.</p>

<p>The Admiral, who was almost as far-seeing in politics
as he was in sea-strategy, had recognised that Buonaparte
was France, and that the policy of Buonaparte was to
swallow the weak nations in order to use their resources
against the Great Powers. Undoubtedly he had his eye
on Naples, and undoubtedly Naples had resources as well
as a position which would render her a very dangerous
tool in his capable hands. The Queen did not think so
much about Naples being a tool in his hands as about the
prior evil of losing her kingdom; but she had a presentiment
of this; and, besides, she hated the French worse
than hell for the murder of her beautiful, innocent sister,
Marie Antoinette. She was a masterful woman, of not
a little capacity, and saw as clearly as the Admiral that
France was only biding a favourable opportunity to seize
her kingdom. The Admiral also believed it suicidal for
Naples to leave the declaration of war to the French; but
he had at the outset more correct views as to entering upon
the contest. Before our Battle of the Nile it would have
removed our principal difficulties to have the freedom of
the Sicilian ports and the co-operation of the Sicilian Navy.
Not that their ships counted in the fighting line. In the
Admiral&rsquo;s opinion neither the Sicilians, nor the Venetians,
nor the Portuguese&mdash;hardly even the Spanish&mdash;signified in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
an action between two fleets. But we were obliged to
waste a good deal of time owing to their fear of supplying
us, and their treaty with the French that only two or four
of our ships should enter a Sicilian port at one time. And
had we had frigates, which they could have supplied us,
for spying out the movements of the enemy, we should
never have missed the French on our first voyage to
Alexandria, and should in consequence have destroyed
their transports, and their army, and Buonaparte, as well
as their fleet. His first view, therefore, was that the
Two Sicilies should wage their quarrel with the French
by forming a base for the British, the only one of the great
Powers left uncrippled in the war with the all-devouring
Republic. He was right, moreover, in judging that the only
immediate danger to be apprehended from the presence of
the French force in the Papal States was the spread of their
pernicious doctrines, and the formation of a base for the
insurrection of the numerous disaffected persons in the
Two Sicilies. The only person who had the power of
driving the French out of Italy was the Emperor, who
feared retaliation by a blow nearer home.</p>

<p>Now, the Admiral was strongly of the opinion that with
Buonaparte locked up in Egypt the time had come for the
resisters of French aggression to act, and therefore he
listened to a plot the Queen had for forcing the hand of
the Emperor, which was forwarded and frustrated by the
indecision of the Emperor and his minister&mdash;Thugut. The
Admiral&rsquo;s part of the work was to volunteer, as coming
from himself, the advice carefully concocted by the Queen,
to the effect that her forces must drive out the French forces
in the Papal States. Fortified with her advice to herself,
she overcame the timidity of her Prime Minister, General
Acton; though her War Minister, the Marquis de Gallo,
proved either too timid, too full of moral courage, too
treacherous, or too honest. Thus further fortified, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
wrote to her nephew the Emperor, telling him just so much
of her plans as might induce him to move, and asking for a
general to command her forces. The Empire had enjoyed
a great name as a school for strategy, but the sending her
a general was intended to commit him. He sent her the
evil star of his reign, General Mack, who brought with him
certain highly sensible advice which he had not the courage
to deliver, either because he quailed before the eagerness of
the Queen, or because he sought the opportunity for distinguishing
himself. The advice he brought in reality was
that, until the Allies were ready to strike together, the Two
Sicilies should only wage war upon the French in Malta
and Gozo, of which the King was suzerain, but which had
been seized by the French. Here there was clearly no
aggression: he was only attempting to repossess his own.
It suited Mack better, however, to march on Rome with a
flourish of trumpets, and to play at preserving the peace
only where it concerned the withholding of facilities from
our fleet.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, Mack and the King
marched on Rome with thirty thousand of what he flattered
Neapolitan susceptibilities by declaring the finest troops in
the world, and forty thousand recruits; while we, for our
part, transported another five thousand of these &ldquo;veterans&rdquo;
to Leghorn to cut off the French base.</p>

<p>Everything, as the Admiral said, was as bad as possible
from the first. Half the troops had to be carried in the
Marquis de Niza&rsquo;s Portuguese squadron. The Portuguese
ships, which were incapable of fighting, were all commanded
by flag-officers who could only accept orders from the
Admiral himself. And the legion was commanded by the
pretentious General Naselli, who persisted in regarding the
Admiral as merely an agent for transporting his troops; and
sent his Summons as he pleased, without even consulting the
British officers; and neglected to act until Captain Troubridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
saw that a catastrophe threatened, and gave him to understand
that the mole would be destroyed by a fire, and
probably the town&mdash;of course by nobody&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>General Naselli was apparently only arrogant and incapable.
The King and Mack were not so fortunate as
we; for half their officers were traitors, one general going
over to the enemy in action and being shot by one of
his own men in so doing. The French were not in
force in Rome, though five hundred of them contrived to
throw themselves into the strong castle of St. Angelo,
which the Neapolitan army was quite incapable of taking.
So there was more blowing of trumpets while the King
made his triumphal entry, and Mack, flushed with his
bloodless victory, went off after the main body of the French,
thirteen thousand strong, who were in the fortress of
Castellana. Whatever <i>morale</i> his army had he ruined by
his ignorance of the first principles of war. He made them
march double the distance over heavy roads in wet weather
which, good marchers as they were, they should have been
asked to do in fine weather; and, thus demoralised, he
brought them face to face with an army who were veteran
soldiers, while they were mere citizens in uniform. They
hardly made any show of fighting. The Admiral has
placed it on record in one of his letters that the Neapolitan
soldier never contemplates fighting, and begins to think of
severing his connection with the army whenever the guns
are loaded. Still Mack&rsquo;s force did all the fighting there
was in the campaign. Out of twenty thousand, a thousand
were killed, and nine hundred wounded, not to mention
ten thousand prisoners. The Admiral wrote to Captain
Troubridge: &ldquo;It is reported that the Neapolitan officers
and many of their men are run away even at sight of the
enemy.&rdquo; Another body of nineteen thousand were put to
flight by a French corps of three thousand after they had
lost but forty men; and the French, proclaiming them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
beneath pursuit, contented themselves with taking possession
of their camp and cannon and treasure chest. The
fugitives poured back to Naples, and the Royal Family
prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>Now, with its army and artillery intact, Naples might
have defied the French, for it had vast numbers of fierce
<i>lazzaroni</i>&mdash;the rough people of the street&mdash;passionately
attached to their King, capable in their steep narrow alleys,
and in the extremely rugged districts round Naples, of
maintaining a most formidable guerilla warfare. It should
have been the Queen&rsquo;s policy to tempt the French to
invade, and to have kept her regular army in reserve
while the enemy were harassed by irregulars. But without
a regular army to keep the French at bay while the
guerillas were doing their work, even a fearless commander
like the Admiral saw that nothing could prevent the capital
falling, in spite of the English ships in the harbour.</p>

<p>The King behaved better than usual. That he had a
certain manliness in him was proved by his fondness for
hunting; and he now declared that, if his kingdom and his
capital were to fall, he would fall fighting at the head of
his faithful <i>lazzaroni</i>. And I think he meant it: life in
exile without means for debauchery had no attraction for
him, though his great-souled wife would have gone through
anything for ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>But some one&mdash;possibly Sir William, who was of a philosophical
turn of mind&mdash;put it before him that there was
no necessity for his kingdom to fall. There were two
Sicilies; and though one of them must instantly be conquered
by the French, the other, now that their fleet
had been destroyed by the English, was as safe from the
French as England itself.</p>

<p>Ferdinand still demurred; he did not pay a great deal
of attention to business, but he knew how small an income
he derived from the island. The same voice reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
him that he had a vast amount of treasure readily transportable,
and that there was plenty of hunting in Sicily
if there was nothing else.</p>

<p>Ferdinand would go, if his money went. He was as
willing to have his last of eating, drinking, and merriment,
before he died, at Palermo as at Naples. Only he suggested
that the <i>lazzaroni</i> must be kept in the dark, or they might
turn and rend, and the guillotine remove royal heads in
Naples as it had in Paris. Having taken this unusual
amount of interest in his kingdom, the King fell back into
his wonted habits, and the business passed into more
capable hands.</p>

<p>Of what followed, Will and I, even more than our other
officers, had pretty close personal cognisance. It was of
course of the first importance that suspicions should not
be aroused; and when, about December 13th, it became
known that the armies of the Queen were irretrievably
beaten, and that General Championnet must be at the gates
in a week or ten days, any increased intercourse between
the Queen and the Ambassador and the Admiral must
have excited the gravest suspicion.</p>

<p>At this moment certain things counted in the Queen&rsquo;s
favour. She had lived in such close and reprobated intimacy,
for example, with My Lady, that a breaking off of
their intercourse would have provoked rather than allayed
comment. Then again, as the Admiral had lived at the
Embassy ever since he had come to Naples, his continued
presence there, instead of on board his flagship, went
rather to reassure people, by showing that he had no fears
of personal injury from a sudden outbreak or incursion.
And Will and I, being in a way his personal attendants,
had enjoyed the run of the Palace so much, that our
constant presence there went rather to show that nothing
particular was happening. Even Will&rsquo;s attachment to
Donna Rusidda, and the unparalleled liberty she allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
herself for an unmarried Sicilian lady of her rank, had its
use, though I do not think that Will was aware of the
extent to which he played catspaw. I am sure that I was
completely in the dark for some days; and it was not until
we were lying in the Bay, out of reach of the fort guns,
giving fugitives from the wrath to come two days&rsquo; grace
that I came near knowing the whole of the truth.</p>
</div>




<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XIX.</span>&mdash;How Two Millions
and a half of Treasure were
smuggled from the Palace to
the British Ambassador&rsquo;s.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> MUST confess that in these ten days between the 13th
and the 23rd of December, 1798, when the French
were coming as quick as they could march to Naples,
the wearing of my lieutenant&rsquo;s uniform gave me a vast
deal of satisfaction. I only had it the night we sailed to
Leghorn, with General Naselli, about whom the Admiral
and Captain Troubridge expressed themselves so frankly,
and his five thousand Neapolitan braves in the fleet. And
at Leghorn we had not been allowed ashore. The Admiral
was sick of the wretched business, for Naselli did not do
anything, and his whole army would have run away from
one of our ship&rsquo;s companies.</p>

<p>So this visit to Naples was my first opportunity for
flaunting my uniform before the female eye. I walked
up from the landing-steps to the Queen&rsquo;s Palace arm-in-arm
with Will, as fine as you please. That is to
say, Will took my arm in a slightly patronising way, when
it pleased him. He was not quite so self-reliant since he
had been angling for the graces of a lady. We had the
liberty of the Palace&mdash;at any rate its ante-chambers and
more public parts&mdash;and I had suggested this jaunt as the
most impressive I could devise for the airing of my
uniform. In the old days it would have been sufficient
that I had ventured on a suggestion, for Will to snuff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
it out. But on this occasion he was graciously pleased
to accede.</p>

<p>We were standing about the great room next the
Audience Chamber entertaining, or rather the centre of
interest to, a circle of officials and young nobles who
wished to hear of the glory that was attending the
Neapolitan arms at Leghorn, when Donna Rusidda crossed
the other end of the chamber. Seeing Will she stopped,
and with the defiance of all Sicilian precedent which had
now become habitual to her, beckoned him, and smiled
a lovely welcome as he came up. After a word he went
back with her through the side door by which she had
entered.</p>

<p>You may be sure that I had it all from him before we
got back to the ship, for his reticence had given way to
a desire to talk of her, which was only bounded by the
limits of my patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-Will,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what a long time you have been
away! The Queen was here asking for you.&rdquo; Whereupon
she tripped away, he following her as he supposed into
the Presence! But when the door had closed behind them
she gave a merry little laugh, and was, I have no doubt,
duly punished for her ruse. But while she was standing
with her right wrist in Will&rsquo;s left hand, and her waist
against the hollow of his right, very submissively, she
opened fire on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to serve me, Signor W-Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you address me like that, Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, W-Will&mdash;dear W-Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I would risk my life, Rusidda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think it is so bad as that. Ruggiero sends
my cartels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it is, dear&mdash;quickly. You know I will
do anything consistent with my duty as a British officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of your duty as one of the Admiral&rsquo;s fine officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
that I am speaking: it is for Her Majesty; and I have
heard your Admiral confess unqualified allegiance to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, tease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not teasing, W-Will. It is really rather a serious
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what am I to do, Rusidda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She disengaged herself gently, submitting with good
grace to a caress in the process, and left the room for about
a minute. When she came back she gave him his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to tell me whose writing this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a glance Will saw whose the upright characters,
written left-handed, were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Admiral&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he answered, with an air of respect
to the writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do with it? may I read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you may read it, if you can, and give it to
the captain of your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will read it out in a slow puzzled way: &ldquo;&lsquo;Give the
rogue a month for cutting laces.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what jest is this, Rusidda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you, dear, and you told me, whose writing this
is; or am I speaking to a fool, Signor W-Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It occurred to Will&rsquo;s practical mind that this was some
jest of the feather-brained court, and that the captain of our
ship was not a good mark for jests. But he felt the pressure
of her hand, and could not resist the eager, lovely face, and
promised to deliver it. &ldquo;Am I to go now?&rdquo; he asked,
rather ruefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not; but you must be back on shore by nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will anybody tell me anything? You seem determined
to keep me in the dark, Rusidda.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, I will tell you something when your captain gives
you <em>what</em> he gives you. Wait until nightfall and then come
on shore. Do you know near the Immacolata a little old
church with a green and yellow dome? You will go in there,
taking with you what you bring from the ship; there you
will have something fresh given you&mdash;and with it you will
come to the Church of S. Ferdinando, opposite one of the
Palace gates. There you will wait until a priest comes out
bearing a cross jewelled with purple stones. You will
follow him, and do what he tells you. Will you do this for
me, W-Will?&rdquo; she asked, with a soft personal pleading
which went straight to his heart; and she liked him none
the less for the steady reservation with which he insisted
on making the promise.</p>

<p>We took our time about making the circuit of the
Castel Nuovo, and on to the steps where our boats lay,
though this may not have been wise in the rather disturbed
state of the city consequent on the rumours about His
Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s army at Castellana and Fermi. But in
truth Will was in no hurry to present the paper which he
had sworn to put in the hands of the captain. Naval
discipline was no light matter in our day. I believe he
would sooner have presented it to General Championnet,
and much sooner to the devil. But disagreeable things
come to what they call in <i>logick</i> a climax, just as good things
come to an end; and, finding the captain on deck, and in a
good humour over the futile attempts of our Portuguese
allies to warp one of the jury-rigged Neapolitan ships of the
line out of the Mole, he made bold to salute him and
present the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your men will be ready, Mr. Hardres. And, before
you leave, inspect them, and see that there are no pistols in
the party. A stray pistol-shot might bring down the Guard,&rdquo;
and he added with a laugh&mdash;&ldquo;though Heaven knows why it
should, considering what goes on in the city every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
The Captain did not volunteer any explanation, and Will
was far too strict a disciplinarian to ask questions. But he
did ask, &ldquo;May Trinder go, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trinder may volunteer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was still quite early in the afternoon when Will
presented the momentous document, but we could not go
on shore again, for we had had our leave. Now, the Bay of
Naples is admittedly one of the most beautiful in the world;
but lieutenants of less than a year&rsquo;s standing are not the
most devoted admirers of scenery at the best of times, and
I do not think that I have ever felt so weary of anything as
I did that afternoon of the Bay of Naples, Capri, St. Angelo,
Vesuvio, St. Elmo, and the other two castles, the Thuilleries
and Pausilippo. I have heard people descant on their
beauties by the hour, but I would willingly have seen an
earthquake swallow them all that afternoon if it had not
interfered with our expedition. As we paced up and down
the deck, they stared at us and stared at us till they almost
seemed to be moving towards us. I can now quite
appreciate the feeling of Vesuvio, if mountains have feelings.
We were of course dying to know how many men we were
going to have and what we were going to have them for;
and Will loved the chance of a brush with anything&mdash;and I&mdash;I
felt that we had had a precious slow time lately. The
men who had conquered a whole French fleet on the 1st
of August, had been compelled not four months afterwards
to watch, with arms folded, a lot of wretched Neapolitans
playing skittles with war at Leghorn.</p>

<p>Well, when night did at last fall, thirty picked men
stepped up to us on the middle deck; and going round them
with a lantern, Will questioned each man if he had a pistol.
None had. They were as fine men as any we had in the
ship, and looked forward to cutlass work, which was always
popular with our sailors. A boat was ready to take us
ashore. The Captain had satisfied himself as to Will&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
instructions, and so far everything was plain sailing. When
we opened the church door, it was a fortunate thing that
Will went first. For a terrible sight rose up before him&mdash;two
huge ghostly black figures, which seemed, by the light
of a dim little oil lamp in front of a saint in a side chapel,
to have eyes and mouth, but no nose. Fortunately Will
had, from childhood, schooled himself to intrepidity, to
prefer death to fear, and so never learnt what fear meant.
His hand did not even seek his sword; he stood up square
and fearless to await the development.</p>

<p>Now, if one of the men had gone first instead of Will, it
might have gone ill with our enterprise from the beginning;
for the odds are that he would have made a furious assault
with his cutlass, if he had not rushed out with a maniac&rsquo;s
shriek.</p>

<p>Will&rsquo;s doubts were set at rest at once, for one of the
figures whispered to him to bring in his men quickly and
quietly, and Will passed the word. Once in there, every
man was provided with a long black robe from the neck to
the heels, a short black mantle and a black hood, with
piercings for the eyes and mouth like the two who had met
Will on the threshold. On the backs of the mantles there
was certain colouring, which we could not distinguish in the
dim light. These were, Will was informed, the dresses of
one of the burial guilds common in Naples; and the Church
of S. Ferdinando, to which we were going, was a favourite
one for such processions to stop at while prayers were read
over the corpse. The men were ordered to draw their
cutlasses and carry them closely concealed under the short
cloaks or mantles, and to hold themselves at Will&rsquo;s command.
He would get the signal from the taller of the two who
met us.</p>

<p>Each man was given a long unlit taper to carry in his
right hand, the cutlass being held in the left ready to grasp.
Our two leaders carried crosses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
Arrived at the portico of S. Ferdinando, we halted.
Another figure in black was standing just inside the door,
with the heavy leather curtain drawn back a chink to watch.
He came out bearing a huge silver cross studded with purple
jewels, and, placing himself at our head, marched us across
to the Palace, which we entered.</p>

<p>There a strange scene awaited us, for in front of a side
door was a large coffin with a pall spread over it, surrounded
by six bearers carrying tapers like ourselves, but lighted.
But the strange thing was that the rest of the courtyard
was quite full of wine carters with enormously long two-wheeled
carts drawn each by three beasts, in the selection
of which there was the strangest medley. I cannot remember
that any one of them had all its three beasts of
burden of the same sort: there were a great many bulls;
and a bull and a horse and an ass, or a bull, a horse, and a
mule, made perhaps the favourite combination. The horses
had scarlet tassels and nets on their heads, and a great deal
of scarlet about their reins, and huge collars surmounted by
a brass erection sometimes two or three feet high, hung
with charms against the evil eye. I do not think the bulls
were decorated. It was a wonderful sight, all these great
tumbrils piled high with wine casks, and the scarlet of their
trappings and the brass of the horse collars glittering in the
brilliantly lit courtyard.</p>

<p>They were all ready and awaiting the signal to depart.
The King, it appeared, was sending a large present of wine&mdash;an
entire vintage, which he thought well of, or had confiscated&mdash;to
the Ambassador&rsquo;s wife, whose hospitalities were
famous; and in the midst of it lay the body of some poor
fellow in the King&rsquo;s household, as likely as not killed in
faithful service.</p>

<p>He was to be buried at Pausilippo, and nothing was more
in keeping with the practice of the vitiated Neapolitan of
that day than that the processions should start side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
&ldquo;The French faction are growing very daring,&rdquo; said the
priest to the officer of the household who was going to
superintend the transportation of the wine to the Ambassador&rsquo;s
palace; for, though drink was plentiful in Naples,
nothing was too trifling for a Neapolitan to steal. &ldquo;We shall
be blest by your company, my father,&rdquo; replied the officer;
and the priest raising his cross and beginning to intone, the
bearers took up the coffin, and Will and I and our thirty,
having lighted our tapers, fell in, two and two, behind. We
then marched out and waited for the carters to start; and a
mighty lot of shouting and beating of bulls, horses and
asses with billets of wood almost as thick as fire-logs took
place to put the tumbrils into motion,&mdash;which at last, with
a tinkling of brass and a nodding of scarlet plumes, and
much jingling of harness-bells, was effected. We passed
down Santa Lucia with watchful eyes; for the alleys
leading off this had an evil repute, as containing some of
the most desperate of the population, and I must say that
there was a very uneasy stir, and a great many more
cloaked gentlemen half concealed than I should have cared
about if I had been alone. But we passed along Santa
Lucia without adventure, and round the foot of the great
rock of Pizzofalcone, and so up past the end of the Thuilleries
towards the British Embassy, intending to part company
at the corner of the road which leads to the Grotta and
Pausilippo. But when we came into a line with the Grotta
we could see in the distance a flare hung from a certain
house, and our leader at once became very uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my preconcerted signal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of a French
marauding party. If you will let us, we will accompany
you to the Ambassador&rsquo;s house, and my party shall remain
there while I go forward and reconnoitre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed, and presently we found ourselves safely
in the courtyard of the Ambassador&rsquo;s great palace, when the
household officer having sent up the letter which announced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
the King&rsquo;s present, My Lady presently came down, and
with great sweetness thanked him, and then turned round
to the priest to inquire respectfully of the reason of the
funeral pageant having entered.</p>

<p>On learning, she would not hear of the body being left
in the courtyard, but motioned the bearers to take it into
a large kind of hall, and then sent them off to have supper
with her servants while they were waiting. But we two
and our thirty made excuse through Will that we were
related to the dead, and were consequently unable to enter
a house until he should be solemnly buried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; she said; and there we stood drawn
up, solemnly guarding the door through which our new
comrade&rsquo;s body had been carried, and watching in an
interested way the unloading of the present of wine which
the King had sent to My Lady. By-and-by, when it was
all finished, the priest went out, and, finding the flare
signal removed, gave the order for us to proceed on our
way to the little graveyard at Pausilippo, where we buried
our comrade with the usual rites; after which we marched
down to our church with the green and yellow dome,
every one of us, I believe, thoroughly disappointed that some
alarm had not arisen to make the priest-fellow with his big
purple-studded cross give us the signal to whip out our cutlasses
from under our cloaks in the Black-eyed Susan style.
However, no such incident happened, and we stepped
into the little church, and resigned our positions in the
guild, and stepped out again without attracting particular
notice; and we went on board our boat, which I remarked
was the launch, with a carronade in the bows, and so to
the ship.</p>

<p>The next day Will and I received a hint that our
presence at the Palace was not desirable; My Lady, who
was a born plotter, very probably conceiving that something
might leak out from our conversation. At any rate she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
bade us come up to the Embassy in the afternoon and
dine with her&mdash;a mark of graciousness which suggested to
our disappointed minds that she had had two fingers in
the pie. I was glad enough. It outraged my dignity when
she kissed me once at the banquet after our day at Pompeji;
and at other times she had made me look foolish in public;
but in her own palace it was indeed a privilege to be near
this woman whose beauty and engagingness I have never
seen equalled. Her whole attitude was so frankly caressing&mdash;I
do not mean in the matter of actual embraces, but in
the gracious warmth and unrestrained naturalness of the
bearing with which she treated all around her, as if they
had been the members of her actual family. But Will
could barely be civil to her. Donna Rusidda&rsquo;s dislike may
have been reflected in him, though I suspect that it was
more his resenting My Lady&rsquo;s influence over the Admiral.
Not, I believe, that at this time he had the smallest suspicion
of any improprieties between them, or even that her attitude
to the Admiral was more familiar than it was to any of us,
whom she might at the moment be patronising in her airy
way. It was more an innocent air of patronage to him,
the familiarity of addressing him as &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; the dragging
him in her train to this or that rout, as if he were an
ordinary gentleman about town proud to have the escorting
of a beautiful woman. Will would have liked to have seen
the same distance between the Admiral and her as there
was between the Admiral and his officers&mdash;a distance which,
even in one so genial, the discipline of the Service made
very marked. Not even Captain Troubridge, who had
been his shipmate for five-and-twenty years, would now
address him as &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; and Will saw no reason why My
Lady should be even as familiar as Captain Troubridge.
There was a streak of hardness in Will&rsquo;s nature, which
made him seem, in that one instance, sensible of, but not
to be moved by, auburn hair and upturned eyes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
laughing mouth, no matter how oval the face or how
faultless the arching of the brows.</p>

<p>And he could see that the Admiral had not this immovability.
He had, further, more active grudges. He
regarded My Lady as being responsible for the Admiral&rsquo;s
accepting the mass of absurd compliments in the shape
of deputations, processions, masquerades, and what not.
Celebrations, in his opinion, should have been confined
to military parades and the like. But at the bottom of
everything I believe his deepest grudge against My Lady
was that, when talking to Englishmen, she had not the
guardedness of an English lady. What she might do with
Italians was different. Extravagance was a national trait,
and it is not surprising that one so prejudiced should have
considered that what was good enough for an Italian was not
good enough for an Englishman. I know now that she truly
was more of a lady in Italian than she was in English; for
in England the people among whom she had formed her
ideas and learnt her mode of speech were dissipated, or of
humble birth; while in Naples she had spent her time
amongst the highest in the land and the most erudite. Sir
William was best as a <i>s&ccedil;avant</i>.</p>

<p>I should have wondered why My Lady did not attempt
to subjugate Will in place of the Admiral, were it not that
I knew it was her pride to reflect herself in the Admiral&rsquo;s
glory. I think she was at this time intoxicated with that,
and had yet no ulterior idea of, through him, having as
great a place in England as she had at Naples. Of one
thing I am quite certain, that she was the most passionate
hero-worshipper, and capable of a passionate affection for a
lovable nature; and no man ever doubted that the Admiral
was the most lovable man in the fleet as well as the most
heroic. But the Admiral, though a well-born man, a great-nephew
of the greatest Norfolk man before him&mdash;the great
Sir Robert Walpole&mdash;was a plain man, small, and with no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
more high birth than beauty written on his face; whereas
Will&rsquo;s proud beauty was more than enough for a prince.
He had, I should have thought, just the beauty and breeding
which she should have found irresistible. There was
generally between them, therefore, no better than an armed
truce, which My Lady&rsquo;s goodness of heart made her constantly
forget and do him as generous a turn as she would
to any of her favourites.</p>

<p>Possession of the Journal has supplied me the clue to
what I did not quite understand at the time. Here, for
instance, is an entry I see:&mdash;</p>


<p class="centerpad"><i>Extract from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal, Naples, Dec. 16th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A most extraordinary thing has happened within the
last hour, which I pray may turn out well. I was sitting
writing at my table by the light of a couple of wax-candles,
placed one on each side of my writing, and with my face
towards the door&mdash;a trick a man, who has been fighting all
his life, cannot get out of when he is going to give such
close attention to a matter as to absorb his sense of hearing.
I heard a faint noise, but took no note of it. On its repetition,
and when I looked up, I saw in front of me a lady
with her hood drawn and enveloped in a large cloak.
These she flung off, exclaiming that she was heated with
running, of which there were evident traces, for the flounces
of her dress were torn and full of dust, and her slippers,
which, like her dress, were of satin, were slashed. She
had come quite close up to the table, not wishing to be
overheard. It was the Princess of Favara, a lady of the
Queen&rsquo;s household, and often with her; whom I have noticed
besides as being the most beautiful of the maids of honour,
who in this country are selected for their beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beside a woman like Emma she is, in the ordinary,
somewhat colourless, though the clear olive of her face
is very fine; but on this occasion it was flushed with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
rich crimson which made her rival even Emma; and her
eyes, which I have noticed as being of a quiet dark grey,
shone blue; and her lips were red as blood against the
small white teeth as she stood for a few seconds open-mouthed
before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Princess!&rsquo; I cried. She put her finger to her mouth
as the words died away on my lips, then beckoned to me.
I went to her; and, putting her hand on my left shoulder,
she whispered into my left ear to know if we were safe
from overhearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I lock that door,&rsquo; I said, pointing to the one which
she had entered, &lsquo;no one can approach without passing
through the room of my watchdog, Tom Allen. And Tom
makes a noise like a bull when he moves, and can be
trusted like the grave.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she told me, in broken English, which I shall not
be able to write down in her words, news of astounding
importance, which she had risked her life to bring to me.
Even a man alone, however well armed, is not safe in the
present disturbed state of the city. But to avoid the risk
of passing the news through even one more person, she
hastily flung her maid&rsquo;s long hooded-cloak over her ball-dress
(they are going through the mockery of dancing at the
Palace, and this is how she was able to slip out unobserved),
and ran all the way here, chased twice or thrice by
drunken or impudent fellows, but saved by the special
Providence which guards the ignorant and helpless. She
had left the dancing, and gone in search of the Queen,
whom she knew to have been packing the famous Bourbon
diamonds to send here; and not being able to find Her
Majesty, and the dancing being weighed down by the spirit
of depression which it was intended to remove, she had
retired to her room, which has a room off it for her maid.
She had taken off her slippers, and was about to disrobe,
for which she needed her maid; but there was no response
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
to her call, so she went to the woman&rsquo;s room, where to her
surprise she found the cloak in which she came to me, with
a message pinned on it&mdash;&lsquo;Be sure to wear this and no one
will challenge you.&rsquo; She removed it to her own room,
intending to question the woman as to what breach of duty
she was contemplating, when she heard voices in the
adjoining corridor, which had a window hereabouts, some
six or seven feet from the ground, to give light, but no
door. With her stockinged feet she could creep to it
noiselessly, and then she overheard a conversation between
her maid and one of the Mergellina family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you found out?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes: the Queen is packing them even now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How are they to go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a chair, as if it were a guest returning from the
dancing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many are to go with it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To escape attention, only the two chairmen, and an
officer of the household inside, and another disguised as a
link-boy, but all of them well armed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What route are they to take?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Along the Strada di Chiaja and by S. Caterina.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You are sure that there are only
four of them? I shall have twenty in case of accident.
We can assemble by twos and threes, and none of them
must get away alive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you find as many whom you could trust?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall not trust them except to murder. Anybody
can be trusted to murder. Only my brother, Don Pancrazio,
and I will know. I should not trust him, if I could
do it alone. You are sure that they will make as much as
that? Perhaps I could do without Pancrazio.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; it will take two to remove them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Even with a mule?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I am sure. The mule must have panniers.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Pancrazio will lead it. I shall lead the men. We will
hide by the steps of the Ponte di Chiaja. There is a
guard stationed there whom I can bribe to let himself
be drugged.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how will you get rid of them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The mule will be out of sight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the four men are dead or past fighting, I shall
raise the alarm?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My men will run away, and I shall cut the throats of
the others to make certain, and there you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And where am I to meet you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the little harbour of Mergellina. I shall have
swift rowers who will take us to a safe point away from
those cursed English. I have sent you a cloak which will
pass you out,&rsquo; he replied. And then the Princess stole back
to her room, put on the slippers she had just taken off,
muffled herself up in the cloak, and passed out without so
much as one of the sentries challenging her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Could you not have warned the Queen?&rsquo; I asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; but that would have stayed the departure of the
diamonds, and all the arrangements would have been to
make afresh, and that in the face of the secret being out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a better general than I,&rsquo; I said to that lovely
eager face. &lsquo;Now tell me what I am to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Send sailors, as many as are necessary to drive the
cut-throats off, and see the chair safely to where the gentleman
inside wishes to go, which will be here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a knock at the door, but so absorbing was
the topic that neither of us heard; then came a louder knock,
and the gravity of a situation, graver even than the loss of
the Queen&rsquo;s diamonds, dawned upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; I asked: &lsquo;will you&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Conceal myself?&mdash;no,&rsquo; she answered proudly; adding
quickly. &lsquo;No one but a friend of Her Majesty would come to
your room at this hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No one but one of my officers,&rsquo; I said; and I felt
myself blushing, for I remembered those two visits from
Emma, and the Princess might not understand the spirit in
which dear Emma comes. Heavens! if it were Emma, in
<i>deshabille</i>! to tell me of a relapse of Sir William and call
my aid! All these thoughts flashed through my mind in a
few seconds. There was a still louder knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What am I to do, Princess?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Open it,&rsquo; she said, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I opened it, with her standing by this table, with one
hand resting on the corner, a picture of pride and innocence.
But the blood flew to her cheeks as Will entered with an
expression of utter astonishment on his face, which I could
see would have turned into something stronger, but for
his filial respect and affection. Disciplined as he was, he
could not keep the question out of his eyes. A lesser man
than Will would have beat a retreat&mdash;most likely have held
his tongue, perhaps for the honour of the fleet, perhaps in
gratitude for future favours. But Will stood plainly&mdash;as
she had said plainly&mdash;&lsquo;Open the door.&rsquo; It was a picture:
these two fine young creatures, so full of pride and
breeding; and, placed in a false position, one whose rank
prevented ordinary explanations, and who, as it seemed,
was party to an injurious situation to which he should
have been superior.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>That moment came near changing the whole current of
Will&rsquo;s life&mdash;not in the direction of ill-will to our beloved
Admiral, though he had wondered how he was to believe
in spite of his senses, but in the direction of winning that
which lay nearest his heart in despite of Katherine&mdash;the
love of Donna Rusidda. Our Katherine can never hear of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
it now without blushing for pleasure. She loves it best of
anything in Will&rsquo;s whole life. For, walking up to Donna
Rusidda, he knelt before her and kissed her hand. As he
rose his eyes fell instinctively upon her feet, which were
beautiful even for a Sicilian aristocrat. The slender
slippers were all dusty and cut, and the ruined white satin
of one of them had a tell-tale stain of blood; and then the
swift intuition of love told him that his trust was justified&mdash;that
she must have run herself from the Palace to bring
the cry for help&mdash;and he knelt once more before her, and
covered her hands with tears as well as kisses. And tears
rained down the cheeks of the conqueror of the Nile, as he
called out in a broken voice: &ldquo;Brave Will! I would rather
have done that than win a battle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a flush of gratitude swept over Donna Rusidda that
she was tongue-tied, and could only thank him with her
eyes, and the glory of beauty at its highest tension. And
Will, dreading the words of gratitude which were struggling
to come, cried: &ldquo;The news, Rusidda? The Palace has not
fallen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that&mdash;but the Queen&rsquo;s diamonds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but in two hours&rsquo; time those who are bringing
them hither will be murdered and robbed.&rdquo; She repeated
what she had told the Admiral.</p>

<p>The Admiral sat down and hastily wrote an order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To the Commander of the Boat Division, Naples Bay.</p>

<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<i>Dec. 20th.</i></p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Give the rogue twelve days to cut the laces.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have your sword, Will? Have you pistols?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take mine. I have had to bring them ashore since I
came down from Leghorn. You are not afraid to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
your way to the boats single-handed? The place is full of
cut-throats now, of a night. I could send some of Sir
William&rsquo;s men with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would attract attention, my Lord; besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides what, Will?&rdquo; asked the Admiral affectionately,
with his hand on Will&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may need them to save the Queen&rsquo;s diamonds.
If I am not back within the hour, you will know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, my boy!&rdquo; he answered, choking; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
d&mdash;d if I think all the diamonds in the world worth such a
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not only for the diamonds, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, my boy. Honour! Duty! It is to win the
right to ask for a post of honour. Remember, if you are
hard pressed, to fire your pistols. If one of our boats hears,
it will dash in and land a party. My orders are, &lsquo;Follow
up a shot.&rsquo;&mdash;And Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay five minutes, while I send Tom Allen to summon
My Lady. Her honour,&rdquo; he whispered, glancing towards
Donna Rusidda, after the good Tom had gone, &ldquo;is in our
joint keeping; and,&rdquo; he added aloud, &ldquo;you love her&mdash;that
I have seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love her, and worship her, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Princess, I may take it that you love him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, no, my Lord; though I owe him the greatest debt
of gratitude which a woman can owe a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral seemed dumbfounded. &ldquo;You will learn to
love him, Princess: he has excellent prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do love him, my Lord; but I do not and cannot
ever love him as a husband or a lover. I love him,&rdquo;
she continued, with a sweet light of gratitude shining
from her eyes, &ldquo;as the finest gentleman I have ever
met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was broken into by the apparition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
My Lady, lovely with rosy cheeks and sleepy eyes. It was
evident that she had been roused from her slumber, but
she was angelically good-tempered over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me, Nelson? Why, Donna Rusidda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess Lion-Heart has brought us grave news from
the Palace. She ran, and by herself; and I am just sending
Will here to the boats for help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will left as the Admiral was going over the ground for the
third time. Donna Rusidda crossed over to the door, and the
Admiral and My Lady were looking out to sea, as she poured
out her gratitude to Will in one long kiss, and commended
his dear life to the care of Santa Rosalia, whose kindly little
lead image she took off her own neck and hung round his.</p>

<p>For what happened after Will&rsquo;s departure I must depend
once more upon the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal; and the way in
which it fills up the gaps is nothing short of marvellous, if
it were not the work of the Admiral&rsquo;s own hand.</p>


<p class="centerpad"><i>Extract from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal, Dec. 20th, 1798.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a delicately adjusted machine is woman, sensitive
to every breath! Having great hopes of the Princess of
Favara and Will making a match of it&mdash;for she clearly is
very well disposed to him, though she refused to admit that
she loved him&mdash;I had withdrawn to the far end of the apartment
when my young lover was about to take his adieux
before departing on his perilous mission. I was about to
call dear Emma, but she anticipated me by running in front
of me to the window. As I went I was curious enough
to steal a glance at the Princess, to see what hope there
was for Will. From which I augured well. She was more
than gracious, she was tender and solicitous, as gentle a
piece of girlhood as one could picture. But, when Will
went, she came back into the room with trailing robes and
haughtily carried chin, as self-possessed as Her Majesty
herself, who is most royal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dear Emma&mdash;though, I am sure, there is something
like a feud between them, and it was in her power,
as mistress of the house, to increase the discomfort of
the situation&mdash;went to meet her with a winning smile of
hospitality, and frank eyes that asked no question. The
Princess, standing back, looked at her searchingly, then
suffered her haughtiness to be disarmed; but she was ill
at ease, and sat wild-eyed, like a captive who has been
assured of good treatment, but deprived of his weapons,
while Emma was outspoken in her generous admiration of
the Princess&rsquo;s heroic deed.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>Will drew his sword as soon as the door of the Ambassador&rsquo;s
palace closed on him, and sped down the hill towards
the sea. He made sure that he should have to use it ere
he passed the end of the Thuilleries&mdash;the fine garden or
park which the King had had planted between Pizzofalcone
and Mergellina. But no one leapt on him out of the
darkness. As he came to the low dwellings at the foot
of the rock near the sea, he felt to see that his pistols were
loose. More than once he was sure he heard whispers,
and the shuffling of feet bound round with rags. Sometimes
his left hand clenched the pistol-butt, as he fancied
he saw figures rise up before him&mdash;though they always
melted into the gloom. But, though his brave heart was
thumping, he saw no one for sure, till he came to the
lamps at the landing, and our own sentry.</p>

<p>And yet, as we afterwards learned, his presentiments
were correct. His whole path had been swarming with
unseen sentries and patrols of the <i>lazzaroni</i>, with whom
our Service stood in the highest popularity at the moment.
Their hearing, and indeed most of their senses, are preternaturally
sharpened; and, though it was pitch dark, they
knew that an English officer was passing through them&mdash;an
Englishman by the firmness of his footsteps, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
officer, not a sailor, by the lighter tread. Had any one
assailed him, he would have had scores of helpers.</p>

<p>What a world of anxiety mankind might be spared, if
it knew!</p>

<p>You may judge my feelings of disappointment when I
learned the next day of the services upon which Will had
been engaged. I had heard that he was retained by
the Admiral, and after the dinner returned to the ship
to report myself. He was going to the Admiral for
orders, at the hour directed, when he came upon him with
Donna Rusidda, the extraordinary nature of whose visit
had made the Admiral&rsquo;s appointment to Will slip his
memory. He could not, within a day or two, time the
arrival of General Championnet and the French army at
his first signalling point; and besides the secretary, Mr.
Campbell, whom he used little for this special correspondence,
he needed one of his officers.</p>

<p>It had been settled that the landing party, whom Will
was fetching, should call at the Embassy for orders as
to where they should post themselves. Rough disguises
would be waiting for them in a room by the little wicket
on the lower side of the palace, which was guarded by
a confidential servant of Sir William, an Englishman, the
grand gates of a palace like the Embassy not admitting of
business of a very private nature. The Admiral would be
at the wicket himself to give orders.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the men, when they were
admitted, to see not only the Admiral but My Lady, and
another strange lady hooded from observation.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that the men, hastily disguised,
marched by a detour to a house belonging to Sir William&rsquo;s
cook, who kept up too great an establishment to admit of
his living on the premises. This worthy had a garden
gate opening into a back street, whose road was almost
as high as the top of his house, the slope being very steep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
Through this gate the men were admitted, and posted in
the house to watch results.</p>

<p>Time passed very slowly indeed. It seemed as if they
had all been fooled by a serving-woman&rsquo;s tattle, when
suddenly the quick clash of steel, followed by agonised
cries for help, sent them flying out, headed by Will. The
dozen sailors made short work of the cowardly assassins,
who were hired to murder without even knowing the why,
or the names of their victims.</p>

<p>The Mergellina Count and his brother had no occasion
to raise the cry of &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; to disperse their followers.
Half a dozen or more of them had already received the long
dispatch, and the remainder would be out of Naples as
far as their legs would carry them. Both chairmen were
slain, being struck before they could set down their load
to defend themselves. They were brave fellows, and would
not drop their burden incontinently. The counterfeit link-boy
had more than one wound, but he was a good swordsman,
and, being on the watch for assault, he had been
able to save himself. The officer in the chair had escaped
the daggers, and had come off with nothing worse than a
concussion as the chair grounded.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost, so making the whole man
change places with the wounded, and substituting four of
our sailors for the two slain chairmen, they went at the
double to the Embassy, and were soon safe inside its
quadrangle. None of the packages were missing.</p>

<p>How they brought the King&rsquo;s pictures, a vast number
by the greatest masters of Italy, and his sculptures, the
most famous of antiquity and some of them of enormous
weight, is a yet more wonderful story; but it is very
long, and I should diminish credence in what I have
written above if I attempted to tell it here. And the
account of how on the Tuesday and Wednesday nights,
the 18th and 19th, we moved them all on board the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
<i>Vanguard</i> would pass belief. There were above five
hundred barrels of money and plate and such; and of
the great cases of paintings and sculptures I can give no
idea of the number or the bulk.</p>

<p>All these we had on board as stores, cleverly collected
by Sir William in the case of the Royal dockyard falling
into the hands of traitors. The <i>lazzaroni</i> had no such
dread of our taking stores as they had of our taking their
King. Indeed, since they looked to us as their best friends,
they were glad to see us getting into trim; and all classes
in Naples, even the overt or skulking sympathisers of the
French, expected no less than that we should be taking in
all manner of supplies. The gold, and the diamonds, and
the works of art, therefore, which had been introduced into
the Embassy with much laboured secrecy, were carted down
to our boats with such a strong force of sailors and marines
as precluded anything like complete concealment, though it
was managed at night, so that the nature of the packages
might pass as alleged. The presence of the Admiral, too, at
such a time, was so natural, that he shifted from the Embassy
on board his flagship without awaking distrust in the large
number of people, who could not outstay the departure of
the British ships. Matters were now fast approaching the
crisis.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XX.</span>&mdash;How the <i>Vanguard</i>
took the Royal Family
to Palermo in the greatest Storm
The Admiral ever knew.</h2>


<blockquote>
<p><i><span class="dropcap">M</span>OST Secret.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Three barges and the small cutter of the
<i>Alcmena</i>, armed with cutlasses only, to be at the
<i>Victoria</i> at half-past seven o&rsquo;clock precisely. Only one
barge to be at the wharf, the others to lay on their oars at
the outside of the rocks&mdash;the small barge of the <i>Vanguard</i>
to be at the wharf. The above boats to be on board the
<i>Alcmena</i> before seven o&rsquo;clock, under the direction of Captain
Hope. <em>Grapnells to be in the boats.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the other boats of the <i>Vanguard</i> and <i>Alcmena</i> to be
armed with cutlasses, and the launches with carronades to
assemble on board the <i>Vanguard</i>, under the direction of
Captain Hardy, and to put off from her at half-past eight
o&rsquo;clock precisely, to <em>row half-way</em> towards the <i>Mola Figlio</i>.
These boats to have four or <em>six soldiers in them</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>In case assistance is wanted by me, false fires will be
burnt.</em></p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nelson.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Alcmena to be ready to slip in the night, if necessary.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At half-past eight three barges, with the Admiral and
Captain Hope of the <i>Alcmena</i>, landed at a corner of the
Arsenal at the point where the opening of the secret passage
debouched. The Admiral himself went into the Palace,
brought out the whole Royal Family, put them into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
boats, and at half-past nine they were all safely on board
the <i>Vanguard</i>. Immediate notice was then given to all
British merchants that their persons would be received on
board every and any ship of the squadron. Their effects
of value had before been embarked in the three English
transports which were partly unloaded, all the condemned
provisions having been thrown overboard to make room
for their effects. Sir William Hamilton had also hired two
vessels for the accommodation of the French emigrants,
which had been provisioned by our victuallers.</p>

<p>They came out of the underground passage from the
Palace to the little port of the Arsenal almost unnoticed&mdash;which,
as it turned out, was most fortunate, for very large
assemblies of people were in commotion, and several
persons were killed, and the body of one, an Austrian of
General Mack&rsquo;s, dragged by the legs to the Palace. The
mob by the 20th even, were very unruly, and plainly had
suspicions; for they gathered in front of the Palace insisting
that the Royal Family should not leave Naples. However,
they were pacified by the King and Queen appearing from
time to time on the balcony and speaking to them. Mack
had sent word on the 18th that he saw no prospect of
stopping the progress of the French, and entreating &ldquo;their
Majesties to think of retiring from Naples with their august
families as expeditiously as possible.&rdquo; It was the leaking
out of this which had so enraged the mob and lost the poor
fellow his life.</p>

<p>I saw Donna Rusidda steal an approving glance at Will,
who stood under the lamps, commanding a guard of more
than honour, drawn up on the quay, and as fine as you
please in his cocked hat and silk stockings and white
breeches, that fitted like skin, lace ruffles, and smart blue
frock coat turned back with white, and gold buttons. Will
did not see her: he never saw any one when he was on
duty except the force under his command and the enemy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
He stood there the very picture of English firmness. He
was assisting at a flight, and in his heart he despised the
Neapolitan Court, and everything that appertained to it,
except a certain dark-eyed damsel who was perfectly ready
to coquet with him in the midst of this very trying scene.
And a very trying scene it was; and I was hoping that he
had on the dress he had worn with her at Caserta, for there
was quite enough sea on to give the boats a good shaking
and splashing, though nothing for ships such as the
<i>Vanguard</i>.</p>

<p>The Royal party were for the most part most woe-begone.
Like true Southerners, the ladies of them at any
rate were mighty poor sailors, and counted on being ill
before they reached the ship&rsquo;s side. And probably nothing
would have persuaded them to trust themselves on boats on
such a day, though the wind was no more than fresh, except
that they looked every instant for the French or a rebel
army to loom out of the darkness&mdash;a consummation which
I dare swear the most of our men devoutly hoped, for
retreats were not to their taste, but if a better appearance
could be put on it by its being effected in the teeth of a
hostile force, it would be a victory of a sort.</p>

<p>But there was no such luck, and the utmost they had to
dread was a wetting.</p>

<p>Donna Rusidda, being a Sicilian, and accustomed to sail
from Palermo on visits to her uncle or the Court, was, as it
proved, a first-rate sailor. I think Will had an inkling of
this, for he took mighty good care that she should not go in
the barge with him; and, had she been as the other ladies,
she would have been at once prostrate and a proper object
for his attentions.</p>

<p>The Admiral was dressed with extreme care in full Court
rig, in order to bring off the Royal Family with even more
punctilio than had been observed at their State visit after
our victory at the Nile. Although it was dark, the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
standard was up at the main, as the illustrious exiles to
the other part of their own kingdom mounted the broad
gangway which had been let down for them. I should have
said that My Lady was in attendance on Her Majesty, and
Sir William talking to the King upon the only two subjects
which at that moment for Ferdinand the First of the Two
Sicilies and Fourth of something else possessed the smallest
interest&mdash;some treasure which he had suddenly recollected,
without which he positively refused to quit the Bay of
Naples, and the prospects of sport at a hunting box in the
interior, a little south of Palermo. As the lamps at the
top of the gangway shone on them, Sir William&rsquo;s tall spare
figure and snow-white hair contrasted strongly with the
King&rsquo;s big powerful frame, heavy jaws and grizzled whiskers.
It tickled my boyish fancy that this worthy and complacent
pair of husbands should both have such very large noses&mdash;though
Ferdinand&rsquo;s was more of the Roman, and Sir
William&rsquo;s of the door-knocker type.</p>

<p>Their beautiful wives were talking busily as they came
on board. Her Majesty proved not a very good sailor, if
it is fair to say that anything could be proved in the
weather which we were about to encounter. The Admiral
was violently sick during its continuance. But I thought
Her Majesty not above the ordinary as a sailor, though
her courage and dignity made her hold out long after other
women would have given in. I judge that My Lady was
pressing the conversation, it being well known how potent
an antidote for the sea-sickness it is to divert the attention.</p>

<p>They came on board the evening of the 21st. For two
days afterwards we had a fresh north-easterly wind, which
disturbed the sea very little, and would have carried us
straight into Palermo. But the King would not be budged,
because of the treasure which had been left behind, and
the Admiral had reasons of his own for humouring him.
Once on board the <i>Vanguard</i>, the Royal persons and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
treasure were perfectly safe, the few French of the line in
the Mediterranean all being blockaded in this or the other
port. But there were others who were not safe, whose
peril was the outcome of the secrecy with which the Royal
Family and the Court and the English in Naples had been
shipped. They were as marked for destruction, when the
French should enter Naples, as those now on the <i>Vanguard</i>;
and the transports and ourselves, lying in the roads for two
days more, gave them all the opportunity of coming on
board us, or the Portuguese vessels, which were always
willing enough if there was no fighting in the wind.</p>

<p>Finally the missing treasure came on board, and the rest
of the fugitives, who had been aided by the boats of the
fleet and the landing of bodies of our sailors. The King
displayed no concern about these unhappy persons who
had to fly because they or their Governments were his
sympathisers. He divided his time between play, and
invocation to the Saints for weather which should at once
be dead calm and have a very fine sailing breeze. To
give him exactly what he desired would have needed much
prayer to the saints.</p>

<p>I must own that sometimes in the year which followed,
as for instance in these two days, I was a little oppressed
by the Admiral&rsquo;s unforgetting kindness. Having it in his
head that I was such a friend of Will, he had impressed
on the Captain a feeling that he desired us to be employed
together as much as the ship&rsquo;s needs permitted. The
consequence was that while other Vanguards, during these
two days, were ashore, having plenty of rough-and-tumble
excitement over rescuing would-be fugitives from a populace
which desired that they should stay and face the music, I
was kept on the ship.</p>

<p>For Will it was well. With the ship crowded with
Italians of rank, the Italian-speaking officer was a person
of importance, and constantly in attendance on the Admiral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
whose state-room had been given up for the Royal party,
with whom were My Lady and Sir William. And there
was really nothing left to be done. Proper parties were
ashore guarding the embarkation of fugitives and securing
that treasure. The duty of warping out the Neapolitan
men-of-war laid up in the Mole, and jury-rigging them,
and taking them to Messina, had been entrusted to the
Portuguese, many of whom could hold sufficient conversation
with Italians. It was impossible to trust the
Neapolitans themselves to remove the ships. It was by
no means certain that they would not prevent it, their
Marine especially being disaffected and honeycombed
with treason. From two of their line-of-battle ships&mdash;they
were three of the line and three frigates&mdash;every man
deserted and went on shore. But we sent a party of our
seamen with officers from the <i>Vanguard</i>, who assisted in
navigating them to a place of safety, which was found,
almost against our expectation, at Messina.</p>

<p>The Admiral having made all possible dispositions&mdash;such
as taking the ships to new berths out of cannon-shot of
the forts, giving orders for the reception of the fugitives
on to any of the fleet, getting the Neapolitan men-of-war
out of the Mole, or burning them rather than let them fall
into the hands of the French, leaving one or two ships to
cruise between Capri and Ischia, in order to prevent the
entrance of any English ship into the Bay of Naples&mdash;remained
with the ladies, feeling that they were in a sense
his guests. At the same time he was visibly desirous of
making the delay, which was mightily irksome to one of his
temperament, speed in the society of My Lady.</p>

<p>Will was, as I have said, in attendance on him, in which
capacity he saw much of the lively Donna Rusidda, who
was the Queen&rsquo;s favourite lady-in-waiting, for her beauty
and her graciousness, as well as for her high rank.
Insensibly at intervals the Admiral and My Lady would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
draw a little apart. Whenever they did so, Donna Rusidda
would assail Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-Will,&rdquo; she began in rapid Italian, interspersed here
and there with a word of English: &ldquo;you want an explanation
from me&rdquo;&mdash;he hoped that she was going to say
something about his suit to her, but she went on&mdash;&ldquo;of
that little <i>billet doux</i> I gave you for your captain. I will
give it to you. That was a cipher agreed upon between
the Admiral and him to give the number of men and how
they should be armed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dear lady, I have guessed that already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the very fine fluid in those wine casks, so
generously presented by the King to the Ambassador&rsquo;s
wife, was drawn from the river Pactolus,&rdquo; and she added,
seeing Will a little mystified by the allusion, &ldquo;whose sands
were of gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I had guessed that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the carters were not ordinary carters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had guessed that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, though they were the King&rsquo;s most trusted servants,
we did not know if we could trust them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can understand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were there, not only to protect them from
attack, but to protect them from thinking. When a
Neapolitan thinks, he thinks treason. If they had stopped,
or not taken the right road, you would have helped them
to guide their unruly animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I did not know what we were
doing, or where we were going, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were under the orders of the priest. He was a
real priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had guessed that. No one else could have
remembered all there was to do with the candles, chanting
and halting for this or that. But, I say, Rusidda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
&ldquo;How did it come that the priest was trusted more than
any one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;that is he. He is the Queen&rsquo;s confessor, an
Austrian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a foreigner,&rdquo; said Will. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the coffin you took from the Palace did not contain
a body at all, but the silver-gilt candlesticks of the Queen&rsquo;s
chapel, and other objects too long to be packed in barrels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had guessed that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did bury a body, and it was for him that they
chanted all the way from the Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something was changed at the Embassy. I had
guessed that; but I thought that they were burying iron
or stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;you were burying a spy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will, who had been in a great battle, and seen a hundred
men knocked over by round shot in a few minutes, got up
and staggered out into the fresh air: the crisp winter night
had just closed round them. To Donna Rusidda, gentle as
she was, the execution was not shocking,&mdash;the man was
of low birth, and swift retribution was no novelty at the
courts of Italian princes. But with a woman&rsquo;s quick wit
she noted its effect on Will, and followed him out into
the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am cruel, W-Will, is it not?&rdquo; she said, laying a hand
on him and whispering in broken English. Then relapsing
into Italian she added: &ldquo;These things are not the same to
us as they are to you English&mdash;it is fighting we dread, not
death. A Neapolitan does not expect to fight, he expects
to kill. The other man will be taken at a disadvantage,
and sometimes defend himself desperately; but he will
have a disabling blow, and when the Neapolitan&rsquo;s own
turn comes, he would rather be killed with one blow than
have the agony of defending himself, though he is very
desperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
&ldquo;How thankful I am that you are a Sicilian, Rusidda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sicilians are worse; they are more bitter, more
revengeful. There is always the vendetta in Sicily. If
you had been a Sicilian, and treated me as you did, even
my brother would have sent a man to kill you. He would
not have fought you: a Sicilian when he is injured does
not wish to risk himself or give his enemy a chance&mdash;he
wishes to be revenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what should you have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps have killed myself; for I loved you&mdash;then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why cannot you love me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say; but it is not possible. But I do love
you much, W-Will, in another way. Come here, W-Will,&rdquo;
she resumed suddenly; &ldquo;it is dark, and we are engaged,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rus&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the eyes of the Sicilian custom, I mean; and you are
trying, and I am trying for the other also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you are trying, Rusidda&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I pray to my Saint also, who is very powerful&mdash;Santa
Rosalia herself, whose blessed image I gave
you. And W-Will, dear,&rdquo; she continued, divining his
disappointment by contact&mdash;it was too dark to see
even the outline of his face&mdash;&ldquo;if you had asked me on
Monday night I should have promised you, and been
miserable for ever afterwards, for I could not have
been unfaithful to an English husband: the English are
not like us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will said nothing, but again she divined, and continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hate to hear a woman talk like that; but women
think like that here, and I could not have done it with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t I ask you?&rdquo; he said desperately.</p>

<p>She answered, &ldquo;Because you were too noble a gentleman.
You thought that I should construe your offer into
pity, and pity into a belief in my guilt. But when you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
knelt before me and just believed in my innocence, I would
have given my soul to be tortured in hell for you; and
I would die now for you any minute of my life. If my
living makes you unhappy for your promised spouse, and
my death will help you to forget me, I will walk through
that porthole there, and the dark water will tell no tales,
and it will only be cold for a little minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would leap after you; I should not care to live without
you, and I am not allowed to go back to the city and be
one of those who have to die fighting the French. Whether
the city resists or not, those black villains&rsquo; thirst for slaughter
will not very easily be appeased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, W-Will,&rdquo; the girl said, nestling close to him (I
remember his description of all this time so well), &ldquo;the
Sicilians hate the French for ever&mdash;we have a vendetta
with them until the end of the world, which was begun at
the Vespers of Santo Spirito, hundreds of years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was very grateful, very sympathetic, and made no
effort to disengage herself from the man she would have
been so glad to love if she only could have forced herself.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark, and, except for the watch, they had
the quarter-deck to themselves. Large parties of the
Vanguards were on boat-duty, helping the fugitives; and
the Neapolitans, on board a ship in which they had to make
a voyage, hated even to hear the sea, and remained below
crowded together. They might have waited longer had
not they heard the cheery voice of the Admiral, who was
in excellent spirits, as My Lady was exerting her charm
and power of entertaining to the utmost in order to divert
people from the situation, which was miserable enough.
It seemed as if the whole Court had crowded themselves
into the Admiral&rsquo;s state-room.</p>

<p>Will saw no more of Rusidda in private that night,
though she was in pretty constant conversation with him.
And her whole nature seemed to have suffered some subtle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
change, but so deep that even he in time found himself
transferring his attention to My Lady, and almost fascinated
with the wonderful mastery over hearts, woman&rsquo;s as well
as man&rsquo;s, which she possessed when she chose to exert her
powers of fascination. She must in truth have been the
most engaging woman who ever lived. Her sympathy was
so flexible, and at the same time I might almost say
audacious, and she added to it such a royal generosity of
feeling, such a perfect command over her charm of personality.
There is a serpent in the East, which the Admiral
had seen in his Indian days, and described to us. This
creature has a kind of hood of skin, which it can erect at
pleasure. My Lady had a power of enhancing the effect of
her beauty which was as extraordinary. I think the power
of her sympathy was due to the vividness of her imagination.
She could put herself in any man&rsquo;s place, and build
his castles in the air. Added to all this, she had a great
passion for being admired and being loved. When I say
loved, I mean deep liking and affection, not grosser love.
That she wished to inspire a passion of affection I am sure;
that she cared for the love, in the sense we often use the
word, of any man except Mr. Greville and the Admiral, I do
not believe, for I know how indignantly she resisted the
advances of the Prince Regent, to whom a few years later
Sir William, with unutterable baseness, did his best to bring
her. It struck me often that this kind of love did not exist
between the Hamiltons, but that she was deeply affectionate
to Sir William.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, we lay kicking about the
Bay, kicking about on the ripple of the north-east breeze, for
three days and two nights, waiting for the word to weigh.
I could not, except in the light of future events, say that
we were wasting time, for I believe that in it we received
into the fleet every person who had both the will and the
power to fly. And the Portuguese, under our Admiral&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
eye, bestirred themselves in making ready the unfitted
Neapolitan ships. But in the two days that followed we
often bitterly regretted the delay, for hardly were we outside
the jaws which the Island of Capri makes with the
horns of the Bay, when there arose the great storm of
which the Admiral wrote, &ldquo;It blew harder than I ever
experienced since I have been at sea,&rdquo; and the wind had
chopped round to the sou&rsquo;-west.</p>

<p>It was about half-past one of the morning when a
sudden hurricane split the <i>Vanguard&rsquo;s</i> topsails, and then
an indescribable scene ensued. An extraordinary tribute
was paid to the greatness of the Admiral. The shivering
Neapolitans expected even the elements to bow down to
the man who, never quite proof against sea-sickness, was at
this moment assailed by it in its most violent form. They
all crowded into his state-room&mdash;I cannot think how many&mdash;and
the air was filled with shrieks of terror; but none, I
am proud to say, from the Royal Family, or Sir William
and My Lady, or Donna Rusidda. Indeed, these two
ladies were as valiant, and had their sea-legs as firmly, as
any in the ship on that awful night.</p>

<p>The Admiral had done all in his power for the comfort
of the Royal exiles. Not only had the whole ship been
smartened up with paint, and every one of the officers
given up his berth, but cots had been specially built for
them. However, at the last, there had been such haste
that no bed-linen had been provided. For the Queen
herself, there was help in the shape of My Lady&rsquo;s own bed.
With her usual energy and foresight My Lady had disposed
her arrangements very well, and had shipped everything of
consequence, except such things as were necessarily left for
maintaining the usual appearances, at the moment of flight,
the value of which I have heard variously estimated from
&pound;3000 to &pound;30,000&mdash;including, for instance, the splendid
State carriage, in which she and Sir William went to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
reception of the Turkish Minister, where they stayed until
the moment of embarkation, leaving their coach and men
peacefully waiting until all the guests had gone; they
themselves having walked out at a side door and so down
to the landing-place in the Arsenal and the barge of the
<i>Alcmena</i>.</p>

<p>My Lady gave up her bed to the Queen, and betook
herself to nursing the Queen&rsquo;s children, poor little creatures,
whose olive-complexioned faces turned a frightful colour,
and whose little hearts were frightened worse than death.
It was on the next day after that, that one little fellow&mdash;Prince
Albert&mdash;having bravely followed the urging that,
if he would but eat a hearty meal, he should be cured, was
taken violently ill immediately thereon, and after lingering
on all day in agony, died in My Lady&rsquo;s arms, with his little
arms round her neck, and her trying to keep him in life
with the fondest and gentlest and most motherly kisses that
ever man saw; thinking, I doubt not, of her own babe
somewhere in England, which she had never been allowed
to see since they took it away from her younger much than
this. Of all that knew, there was not a dry eye in the
ship. Even the Queen&rsquo;s proud courage broke, which danger
at embarking, sickness, and the prospect of death more
imminent from the sea than it had been from the knives
of the rebels or the guillotine of the French, had been
unable to shake.</p>

<p>As the tall, slender form of the daughter of Maria
Theresa walked in proud uprightness on to the barge, and
up the gangway of the <i>Vanguard</i>, she looked the great
Queen that she was. Her Majesty had her faults and
plenty, but it was not in the face of peril that you saw them.</p>

<p>The only one of all the Queen&rsquo;s household that had both
the will and the power to help was Donna Rusidda, and
she helped My Lady in mercy to the children. Indeed,
she had the whole care of them whenever My Lady was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
waiting on the Queen, which was often, she doing the work
of half a dozen servants, lest the Queen should ever lose
the appearance of being a queen, at the moment when her
dynasty seemed to be in the balance.</p>

<p>There was much difference in the way they handled
their charges. My Lady gathered them in a large motherly
way, showing how strong in her lay the mother&rsquo;s instinct,
which was never to have its full expression. They swarmed
over her, little sick things, but bravely obeying their
mother&rsquo;s behest not to cry or speak their fear. She fondled
them, and crooned to them, and her great sympathetic
nature was like a fire to warm their marrowless bones.</p>

<p>Donna Rusidda, on the other hand, knew little of children,
had no instinct for them; but even at such a moment they
could not be indifferent to the prettiness of her slender
person, undisordered in the least by the storm. She was
beautiful, and undismayed, and full of tender smiles, and
making jest of everything that flew from side to side, as the
ship lurched over and stayed so long down that it looked
as if it would never rise again. And then it did rise, and
slowly climbing over the hill of its own centre, went down
even deeper on the other side, with a crash of everything
that could move. She knew of no more to amuse them than
to bid them watch for the biggest lurch; and yet the picture
of her unruffled courage and beauty, and the ring of her
laugh, and her outstretched arms, won their childish hearts,
more especially when, with two clinging to her, she called
to Will, whom the Admiral had kept among the fugitives
so close-packed in his state-room, to make the ladies of a
better heart. And better, indeed, he could not have chosen
for the purpose. As far as sickness went, I was as good
a sailor as Will; and, as my fellows in the gun-room had
often cheerfully pointed out, it was our profession to die
an early and violent death. Which I was perfectly ready
to do&mdash;much readier, indeed, when life was full of life, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
I had a long life before me, than now when I am shelved.
But Will, with his tall bolt-upright figure, his proud fair
face, and his stern blue eyes, had as much effect as any
of the saints they were beseeching could have had by
appearing in the midst of them. Here was one beyond
the reach, as it were, of human weaknesses. Indians have
worshipped lesser white men as gods. The children, too,
were glad of Will: he had often been about the Palace
talking to them&mdash;indeed, he was the only officer in the fleet
who could talk to them&mdash;and the poor little pallid wretches
expected this grand sailor, whom they thought a much
finer man than the Admiral, to do something. All he did
was to hover back to Donna Rusidda, whenever none of
the other ladies were shrieking for him, and help to hold
the children from being flung about. He showed them
all the respectful kindness that was in his nature. For the
Queen (except her courage) and the Court (except Donna
Rusidda) he had, as has been shown, a feeling something
like loathing and contempt; but he had been brought up
with High Tory ideas, and for Royalty in the abstract
he had a courtly respect, and to these poor bits of Royalty,
half dead with sea-sickness and fear, his heart opened
beyond its wont.</p>

<p>There was another difference between the Sicilian
Princess and My Lady. My Lady let all the children cling
to her together, even when they were sick, thinking it
cruel to them to flinch and that she could change her
dress if need were. The Sicilian Princess, on the other
hand, would have no more than two of them at once; and
holding them tenderly, but adroitly, helped them through
their troubles, always contriving to shrink her pretty
person out of the danger. Even Will performed the office
quite creditably; and, being in his oilskins, had no fear.
Two minutes on deck in such a sea would put that right.</p>

<p>His eyes were much on Donna Rusidda. It gratified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
his fastidious soul to see a woman keep her daintiness in
such a stye, and her courage, and her laughter, when the
high-sounding officers of the Sicilian army and navy were
a wallowing mass of Saints and sickness. But I, looking
in to see where I could be of any use, was not blinded
by my love for Will from seeing that neither he standing
so godlike, nor the Princess playfully caring for the
children, and thereby showing her stout heart, were
comparable to My Lady, whose loveliness must have been
dimmed, if such loveliness could have been dimmed, while
she wandered with her hair and her clothing pulled awry
by the children&mdash;aye, and by the grown-up men and women
of the Court too&mdash;performing the offices of an angel and
many servants.</p>

<p>I do not know if at the moment she was enhancing her
beauty in the manner I have described,&mdash;she had the gift
at will of intensifying it,&mdash;but certainly it seemed as if no
human countenance could have before held so much serene
loveliness, yearning sympathy, tender pity, and blithe
courage. She was the angel of all and the servant of all.
She was never in her bed through all the three days of the
storm. The moment at which she was lovelier than ever
I saw her in her life, was when poor little Prince Albert,
who had eaten the good breakfast that she bade him and
been in violent pain and sickness ever since, at seven
o&rsquo;clock of the evening threw his little arms convulsively
round her neck and vomited out his life, his mother the
while being prostrated with the sea-sickness, as she was
after to be with his death.</p>

<p>The approach of the child&rsquo;s death roused the Admiral
from his own sickness. The approach of battle or death
was always like a trumpet-blast to that commanding
spirit, and he was present when the little child died, calmly
but convulsively, in the arms of the good woman. For
in moments like this My Lady was a woman as good as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
ever breathed. The Admiral was completely overcome.
When we were taking up our station at the Nile, the
broadside of the <i>Aquilon</i> crashing into our bows laid a
hundred of our men on the deck wounded and dying, but
his cheek never turned, as it turned at the passing of this
seven-year-old slip of exiled Royalty. All through the
24th from the hour after midnight, and all through the
25th, and all through the long dark hours of the early
morning of the 26th, till we were under the lee of the
port of Palermo, this tempest raged. It seemed, as
Sir William, who palmed himself on his <i>mots</i>, observed,
as if the fiends of the lightning and tempest were stretching
out their hands for those snatched from battle, murder,
and sudden death. And the cruelty of it was that for
a full four hours before the child died we were in sight
of Palermo, lying between Zaffarano and Monte Pellegrino
on our larboard hand. But the storm was such that there
was no hope of our making the port, which lies as it
were in the arm of Pellegrino. There were we, with
the King&rsquo;s own child dying of sea-sickness in sight of
his island-capital, and the greatest Admiral in all the
world powerless to take the ship into the harbour. But
in the night the wind changed again, and at 2 a.m. we
were safe at anchor within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the Villa
of the Marquess de Gregorio, where it was the custom of
the old Viceroys to repair on landing.</p>

<p>What a contrast to My Lady&rsquo;s heroic energy, mingled
with the utmost womanly tenderness, was the behaviour
of Sir William in these awful days and nights!&mdash;though,
indeed, he showed in a high degree the philosophical
temperament which had won for him the title of Pliny,
much used by My Lady before their marriage.</p>

<p>Whilst she was animating with her exertions and sympathy
the miserable flock of refugees huddled in the
Admiral&rsquo;s state-room, Sir William sat in his wife&rsquo;s cabin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
with a loaded pistol in each hand. When she first came
upon him in this extraordinary attitude, she gave such a
wild shriek of alarm as the fiercest of the storm could not
draw from her. But Sir William, in a cold voice and with
an impassioned face, bade her not be alarmed. He had
no designs upon any other life than his own, and not even
on that until it should be certain that they were going
down without hope of rescue. He was merely resolved
not to die with the guggle-guggle-guggle of such an unpleasant
fluid as sea-water in his throat, and was therefore
prepared to shoot himself as soon as he felt the ship to
be sinking. It is not certain whether he sat on like a
statue, in the same position for the whole two days; but
in the laughing time after the retaking of Naples, when
all the dreadful memories of the storm were lost in one
long <i>festa</i>, My Lady used to vow that, often as she went
into the cabin, she never found him to have moved a
muscle from the original position.</p>

<p>I should mention that, from the moment we were in
sight of Palermo, His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s royal standard was
hoisted at the maintop-gallant masthead of the <i>Vanguard</i>,
and was kept flying from that until His Majesty got into
the <i>Vanguard&rsquo;s</i> barge, when it was struck in the ship and
hoisted in the barge, and every proper honour paid to it
by the ship. As soon as His Majesty set foot on the shore
it was struck from the barge. The King did not leave the
ship till 9 a.m., thinking a proper reception of importance.</p>

<p>It is not often that men whose trade is war are impressed
with the beauties of peace, as I was on that December
morning, the 26th, of 1798. The day before had been a
tempest so awful, that not only had the little Prince died
of sea-sickness, but among all those hundreds of people,
for the most part without ceasing praying or shrieking out
their religion, not one that I heard recalled that it was the
day on which the little Christ was born to be the Saviour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
of the world. Agonised appeals to His Virgin Mother I
heard in plenty; but so frightened were all these shriekers,
that they did not remember to invoke her aid for the sake
of the man-child, which it was the hope of every Jewish
woman to bring into the world, in case he should be the
prophesied Messiah, whose advent was the comfort of
the long captivity by the waters of Babylon.</p>

<p>When daylight dawned on the 26th all traces of the
storm had passed within the harbour; and indeed there
was very little sign outside, for as the storm had been
from the south-west, the sea had dropped when the wind
veered. With the iron discipline which prevails on a
man-of-war, all traces of disorder on the deck had been
removed in the two or three hours which intervened
between the dropping of the anchor and dawn, and Palermo
itself was just rising from the mists of sleep. Of the main
part of the city we could see but little from the port, which
is on the outskirts. We could only see the tops of palaces,
each with its moresco-looking loggia in some part or other
of it, for taking the air in the heat of summer. The
Palermitans do not leave their city in summer, deeming
it proof against the <i>mal&rsquo; aria</i>, but rather in spring and
autumn.</p>

<p>Right and left, too, we saw the two fortress-like mountains
which terminate the horns of the Bay&mdash;Pellegrino to
the north-west, and Zaffarano to the east.</p>

<p>In front of the de Gregorio Villa there is a broad paved
quay, and the silence of the city was accentuated by the
faint prolonged bleat of flocks of white goats, led by one
with a bell, which stalked along this quay, and turned up
at the street which leads into the upper city. There were
often no herds or dogs with them. These goats will go of
their own instinct to where they are milked. The impressions
I gathered as I stood on the deck, in charge of the
men who were making the preparations for the Queen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
leave, was one of white palaces and green lattices and
decaying moresco ornament. As the mists rose I could see
that the city was in an amphitheatre of mountains. In
Palermo, I noticed afterwards, there is a mountain at the
end of every street.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock the Queen, in the profoundest grief&mdash;heightened
by the fact that she had no black to wear, as
she accompanied the body of her child&mdash;and with the pride
and grace at last shrunk from her tall figure, was rowed
ashore in the plainest manner in the Admiral&rsquo;s barge, the
Admiral himself escorting her, and none but Sir William
and My Lady and body servants being permitted to
accompany. Plain coaches lumbered round the corner,
summoned in some mysterious way at the moment they
were wanted, as the chariot of Pluto rose from the plains
of Enna. So, I am told, Sir William observed, in his cold
classical manner.</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of it all was that the poor Queen was
taken ashore in the quietest possible fashion, the moment
that daylight permitted; Sir William and My Lady accompanying
her for the nonce to the Palace, which is above
the Cathedral by the Monreale Gate.</p>

<p>The Admiral was to have a villa here of his own, that
belonging to the Marquess de Gregorio, at the Pellegrino end;
whilst Sir William and My Lady were to have theirs by
the Flora, at the other end of the sea front. This was
the word, though every one surmised that if the Hamiltons
were not found with Her Majesty, the Admiral would be
with them.</p>

<p>At 9 a.m. the King, who was not so affected by the
death of the Prince Albert that he could not bear to go
on shore in a public manner,&mdash;after a hearty breakfast,
amid the thunder of artillery, which broke most of the
windows of such of his faithful subjects as lived in the
neighbourhood of the port,&mdash;stepped on board the Admiral&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
barge, which instantly flew the Sicilian standard, and was
rowed to the steps, where he was received with the loudest
acclamation and apparent joy. And in the life that they
led during those months at Palermo, I often thought that
the King&rsquo;s manner of landing was more seemly than the
Queen&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the earliest and most impressive things which
happened to us in Palermo, was our visit to the
Favara, the ancient Arabo-Norman palace of Donna
Rusidda&rsquo;s brother. She invited me to go with Will, and
sent her rumbling old coach to fetch us, for it was a little
way out of Palermo. The horses were sorry nags, and the
coach had been painted so often (by the coachman) that it
had almost lost its shape; but the men had on gorgeous
liveries, much decayed, and apparently handed down from
former servants, whom they had fitted better.</p>

<p>We two boys, almost lost in this huge conveyance,
abandoned ourselves to the novelty of the situation, until
we came to a great saddle-back bridge, with nothing but dry
land underneath it, and apparently crossing nothing. This
the coachman, who could speak a little Italian, informed
Will was the bridge of the Admiral: he did not know who
the Admiral was, though he was sometimes spoken of as
the Greek Admiral, and the bridge was built long, long
ago, even before the time of the great Emperor Frederick,
who had built the Favara, and was the ancestor of the
present Prince&mdash;&ldquo;in a particular way, of course,&rdquo; added
Will to me as he translated his words. The river Oreta
had in those days run under it, and was so fierce a torrent,
and had drowned so many people when the storms came,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
that the Admiral had been canonised by the villagers of
S. Giovanni of the Lepers, to which we presently came, and
peered with curiosity at its ancient church, the most ancient
above ground in all Sicily.</p>

<p>The road now became very bad, lying for the most part
between high walls of rough plaster, enclosing orange
groves or lemon gardens. We passed, too, many clumps
of the Indian fig, an extraordinary thorny cactus which
bears a delicious crimson fruit; and the lean Sicilian
bamboos, more like whipping-canes than the solid jointed
trunks brought from the East.</p>

<p>At length we came to a place where there must have
been a park gate, though it had now been removed, and
replaced by doors of a common character. These were
opened on our arrival by an old man with his head tied
round in a red handkerchief, and we found ourselves in
the midst of a very large grove of lemons, incomparably
beautiful, I thought, with their dark green foliage studded
with the pale gold globes of the lemons, and the ground at
their roots covered with a crop of weed with a leaf like the
trefoil, and a brilliant yellow flower somewhat like the
musk.</p>

<p>From this at length we emerged in front of an enormous
palace, built of a yellowy brown stone, with a turret in
the centre, and very fine Arab or Norman windows: I am
not architect enough to say to which these splendid mouldings
belonged. But the palace, which seemed as great or
greater than the King&rsquo;s, was sadly decaying, some parts
being no longer inhabitable, and the windows of such rooms
as were used being filled in till they held modern panes.</p>

<p>A more picturesque object it is not easy to imagine, than
this huge mellow pile, with its weather-softened turret in
the centre, standing under the shadow of the grim brown
rock of Monte Griffone, and almost buried in a prodigal
wealth of lemon trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
Our coach lumbered in through an old gate into a huge
sort of castleyard, from whence we were taken by a dark
and very narrow stair into the part inhabited by the family.
Between our leaving the miserable old coach, which had
brought us, and reaching the salon, where the Prince and
his sister were awaiting us, we were handed on by a dozen
broken-down servitors, who looked as if they had been taken
out of the fields, and thrust into the liveries of other days.
But we were mistaken perhaps about the fields, because
Donna Rusidda, with a mixture of frankness and pride and
shame characteristic of her, soon informed us that the ground
up to their very doors was let to a farmer, who also occupied
the parts of the palace which had the barred windows, he
being more fearful for thieves of his lemons, than they for
thieves of the heirlooms which had come down in the
family, some of them from the days of the Hohenstaufen
Emperor&mdash;and the precious tapestries woven on Sicilian
silk looms in the fifteenth century which were hanging
round the chamber where we were received.</p>

<p>This at any rate was princely, for it was of great size
and had a vaulted ceiling, with moulded ornaments in the
peculiar inverted Arabic style, which looks not so much the
design itself as the mould in which the design was executed;
while at intervals round the chamber were pairs of columns
with marvellously carved capitals, supporting large vaults
filled with wonderful mosaics representing hunting scenes.
The walls in between these columns consisted of large slabs
of porphyry divided by slenderer columns; or the rich
mosaic borders known as the Cosmato work. This we saw
when Donna Rusidda drew aside the famous silk tapestries.
The chairs, too, and the couches, which ran all round the
walls, were ancient and magnificent; though the brocade,
with which they were covered, was in many places threadbare
or even split. The floor was covered in the Sicilian
fashion with tiles, a hundred or more of which went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
form each of the great arabesque patterns, which looked
like vast love-knots tied with orange and blue ribbons.
There were no carpets, and there was a general appearance
of decay, even of mould, in the room, in spite of its princely
proportions and priceless tapestries. But the youthful
pair who were there to receive us, for all the decay of
their house and the rustiness of the faithful servants who
surrounded them, looked princes every inch, worthy descendants
of the mighty Frederick.</p>

<p>For one thing they were but recently back from long
attendance at the Court, and were dressed accordingly. For
another it was at the Court that Will and I, though we were
but junior lieutenants in His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s ship the
<i>Vanguard</i>, and not long since midshipmen, had met them.
The flavour of royalty therefore was strong, and there was
in them both an innate princeliness. I am sure that Donna
Rusidda, as she came forward to welcome us to the poor
house, in which she had been born, and her ancestors
before her, for five hundred years, looked as fit to be a
queen as any woman in Europe: she was so beautiful, her
nostrils, her mouth and chin were so delicately cut. I have
seen no cameo of antiquity equal in beauty of outline to
that which she had executed and presented to Will the time
we sailed away to the reconquest of Naples&mdash;the cameo
which every day is pinned on black velvet upon Katherine&rsquo;s
wrist, for she is a gentler memory to Katherine than even
to Will. And her slight figure had the self-reliant elegance
of the women of her country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the Favara, W-Will!&rdquo; she cried gaily,
&ldquo;and you, Signor&mdash;Tubbie&rdquo;; and then she broke off into
a little peal of laughter, while the Prince frowned at the
liberty she was taking with His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Lieutenant
Trinder of the <i>Vanguard</i>. But seeing that I took it
as a good jest, he laughed too, a charming Italian laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Palace of the Favara,&rdquo; said Donna Rusidda, &ldquo;has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
a great many doors and windows, but only one chamber
that you can call a room. Ruggiero has his little sleeping
closet, and I mine, and our faithful servants have a roof over
their heads&mdash;some of them; but the palace consists not of
rooms, but of rats and passages. There is a place in which
we have our frugal meals, but the plaster has worn off the
walls until you lose the decorations; and there is the chapel.
Yes, there is the chapel, with relics of I know not what
value&mdash;the palate of one of the Apostles, and even a little
piece of St. Veronica&rsquo;s handkerchief, as thick and strong as
the sacks with which our good farmer loads his ass. But
these one could never sell, and indeed, though they are of
the highest value, no one would give anything for them.
And so they remain in the chapel, and serve no purpose but
to frighten thieves from the gold in which they are enclosed.
Are we to chase the rats until it is time for the <i>colazione</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This meant, of course, my following with the Prince,
while she tripped lightly about the enormous old palace,
calling to Will to see that and the other feature, which had
played its part in her childhood, such as the carved figures
on each side of the great fireplace in the banqueting hall,
which had been real giants in her fairy tales, but now had
the daylight from the hole in the roof exposing them.
There were, I suppose, a hundred or two rooms in the
palace, connected by stairways innumerable, and galleries
hung with portraits of no great value, representing the
Admirals and Condottieri, and Statesmen of the house, but
no Cardinals with diplomatic faces and purple mantles&mdash;no
Cardinals.</p>

<p>I daresay Will found the <i>colazione</i> unmercifully long,
though it was none too long for me, for I could appreciate
all the good things&mdash;the best to be had in Palermo&mdash;which
the pride of the Prince had compelled him to provide for us,
with incomparable wines which had been maturing in his
cellars for half a century. The price of that &ldquo;collation&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
would I daresay have kept their larder going on its ordinary
terms for more than a month. To be at once a boy and a
sailor gives one a proper appetite for such things. And I
ever had as keen an appreciation of a beautiful woman as
most men; and these Italian and Sicilian women, when they
choose, can be so infinitely alluring, with their little laughter
and their merry wit, and their open pleasure in their
beauty. Donna Rusidda was in the highest spirits, and
since all talked English, as being my only language, her
broken English made her flashes of wit irresistible.</p>

<p>When at last the <i>colazione</i> was over, and I had refused to
take another drop of the mellow generous wine, grown on
the neighbouring slope of Misilmeri, we wandered out into
the pleasure garden which was the saddest-looking thing,
for I believe that every joint in the masonry of the terraces
and fountains and colonnades, and marble couches overlooking
the city and the bay, was gaping and ready at a
touch to pour out its mortar in powder. We sat down on
the terrace which had the marble couches I have mentioned,
commanding the view as far as the great dark mass of
Monte Pellegrino, where the Carthaginian General maintained
his army for three whole years against the Romans
in Palermo, supporting life on the wheat grown on the
broad top of the mountain, and the wild fennel and wild
onions. At one end was a little mound, such as I think
they would call a calvary, save that at the top of the path
which wound round it there was no crucifix, but a little
shrine to Santa Rosalia, the patroness of the city and of
Donna Rusidda herself, Rusidda being one of the abbreviations,
in which Sicilians delight, of this name.</p>

<p>In this there was a seat concealed from view, even from
the terrace, where I sat with the Prince while they went
up for Will to be shown her saint. The Prince, desiring
nothing so much as his sister&rsquo;s marriage with Will, and
being at this time, like many of the Sicilians, a violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
adherent of English customs, was content to throw opportunity
in their way. He and I smoked. What passed
between Will and Rusidda I had from Will afterwards,
rehearsed with growing excitement, but I dare swear
without any embellishment from the imagination, of which
Will possessed little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, W-Will,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;now you have seen my
home, and you know that it is not because you are poor
that I fear to marry you. We live on maccaroni in order
to have horses for the old coaches in our stable, and men
to take us out. Were it not for the little salaries which
we have from the Court, we could not buy ourselves a
change of clothes, and even the Queen is not very good at
paying. She would rather buy things, and give them to
you when she is tired of them. And this, though the
Ambassador&rsquo;s wife is not too proud, a Princess of Favara&mdash;with
an unconscious little access of <i>hauteur</i>&mdash;could not
tolerate. Besides, picture me in a train of Her Majesty,
who would make two of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, suddenly springing up from her seat, she led him
to another side of the belvedere&mdash;for such practically the
shrine was&mdash;and pointed to a beautiful little lake. &ldquo;That,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;is the Mardolce, from which our family derives
its name. Its founder was known in the Norman fashion
as Tancredus de Mari Dulci; and that is where we shall
have to come to, if we get much worse off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Rusidda!&rdquo; he said, putting his arm round her
to draw her back to their seat. A little shiver passed
through him. True love can picture any far-fetched ill
reaching the loved one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not very likely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am the only
maid of honour the Queen has in Sicily: the others preferred
facing the French to the sea-passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment, glancing through the balustrade of the
belvedere, she caught sight of a well fed but badly shaved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
priest riding on a stout ass, which carried panniers piled up
with various kinds of garden produce, as well as himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the priest of S. Giovanni,&rdquo; she said, with a
curious look at the stout red-faced form in its stained, rusty
black. &ldquo;What a shock he would have if he saw you! It
was he first told me the tradition of our house, that it
would end with the love of a woman for a fair-haired
stranger. But W-Will, dear,&rdquo; she said, with a caressing
look and remorseful voice&mdash;she was really fond of him, and
it was the first time she had welcomed him as hostess in
her own home&mdash;&ldquo;I am safe, because I have tried so hard
to love you, and cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you take such pleasure in torturing me,
Rusidda? It is right that you should feel safe, but not for
that reason. I am not a prince, and I cannot offer you a
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A palace!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;a ruined village! <em>My house
is not large, but at any rate it is not in ruins</em>, you were
going to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, dear, I hope I shall never say anything to
hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can never tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I was going to say was,&rdquo; he protested rather
hotly, &ldquo;that I have saved quite a good bit of prize-money
already, and that under the Admiral I shall make enough
to retire on in a few years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of the Admiral&rsquo;s name her face changed
a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, Rusidda&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances he would have caught the
tempting rebellious creature in his arms, and trusted to
beating down her defiance with the vehemence of his
embrace; but, having been accorded the freedom of
embracing her, he took no such extreme measure. When
once a woman has accorded a man this freedom, it is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
the vehement but the gentle embrace which steals her heart
or her judgment; and therefore it was only with lips laid
softly on her neck that he asked, &ldquo;Oh, why will you not
marry me, Rusidda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you I cannot love you; besides, I have told
you about the fair-haired stranger. I look so like being the
last woman of my race that it would not be safe for me to
marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy believing in an old wife&rsquo;s tale like that!&rdquo; he said
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do not,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;or perhaps I do. But do
not scoff at that, for it is your best friend. It has been the
tradition of our race to fly in the face of prophecy. Besides,
my people are not your people, and it is a long way&mdash;I do
not know how far, perhaps thousands of miles&mdash;from Sicily
to England; and we are a people who live in a summer
land, where one can even gather figs of thistles, but where
everything one gathers turns into the lotus before it reaches
the mouth, and robs the mind and limbs of all desire saving
to eat and drink and be merry. And we of Sicily, called
of the ancients the &lsquo;laughing land,&rsquo; cannot even be merry,
for every race which has conquered Sicily knows that it
must itself be conquered afterwards. And the land of the
vanquished of many races sits with dry eyes and sunburned
limbs, the Andromeda of the ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will was not scholar enough to plead that he was of
course the Perseus, but she did it for him. She continued:
&ldquo;And we can have no Perseus, or your northern land
might well be it, for the curse of the gods is upon us; and,&rdquo;
she added sceptically, but not so sceptically as superstitiously,
&ldquo;in the centre of the island is the entrance to
the lower world, with <i>solfataras</i> for miles round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusidda, you cannot be serious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear W-Will, I am serious, so far as that I cannot love
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps there is some one else?&rdquo; he said, a sudden
light breaking upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I can give you my word I have never even thought
of marrying some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are trifling with me,&rdquo; he said to her fiercely.
&ldquo;Can you not see that I love you with all my heart and
soul; that it is a matter of life and death; that I could kill
the man who should come between us?&rdquo; and then he struck
his fist on the marble table of the belvedere. &ldquo;There must
be some one trifling with your feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed there is not, W-Will,&rdquo; pleaded Rusidda, a little
scared by his vehemence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, kissing her tenderly; &ldquo;but oh,
Rusidda, you do not know how your refusal maddens me&mdash;how
it dries my life-blood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, W-Will!&rdquo; she said, with a sad smile, while surveying
the sinewy figure, the bronzed face, the clear proud
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mock me, little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mock you!&rdquo; she said, her arms round him in an
instant: &ldquo;have I not told you I pray the good Santa
Rosalia, night and morning, to change my heart towards
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you swear not to love any one better than me?&rdquo;
he added desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot swear; but I shall never marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God in Heaven!&rdquo; was all he said; and, snatching her
hand to his lips, he came down from the belvedere with
bowed head, and walking straight past us without raising
his eyes, rushed through the lemon grove and out of the
gate and down between the high walls of the groves.</p>

<p>The Prince divined what had happened, and for the
nonce said nothing.</p>

<p>Soon Donna Rusidda came down&mdash;beautiful, tender, and
repentant; and when I sought to make my <i>adieux</i> to such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
a painful situation, inquired if I would take a note to Will.
Thinking it might be to give him the news he so courted, I
joyfully assented, and we all three walked up to the palace
and into the salon with the silk hangings where she had
first received us, and off the end of which there was a little
room, into which she retired.</p>

<p>The Prince, taking me by the arm, walked me to the
other end. He was much agitated. &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;is changeable. That she has refused to marry your
friend, the match upon which I have set my heart, is
certain; and yet I am equally certain that she loves him,
for she cannot conceal her joy when she is going with
Her Majesty on board his ship, or to any party where your
Admiral and his suite will be. I can see that there is
much tenderness between them. She allows him the liberty
which neither she nor I would tolerate in any other man;
and yet she must have refused him, and I think roughly.
It cannot be,&rdquo; he resumed presently, &ldquo;that she fears and
forgets the tradition of our house, lest the prophecy should
be fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he continued with evident relief, as she came into
the room again, carrying a letter, and with her face glowing
with tenderness: &ldquo;she has repented. Go, my friend, and
take it from her. The word which accompanies a letter is
often a key to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing me advance, she halted, and, when I came up,
I looked in her dark shining eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a letter to Signor Hardres,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;bidding
him to come again soon, and be sure to bring the Admiral
with him. There is no one to whom the immortal Nelson
listens as he listens to Signor Hardres; and it is the desire
of my heart that the hero should pass one night underneath
this fast-decaying roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brother, who had been watching for her expression
to tell him when she had finished what she most desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
to say, then joined us; and she told him that she had been
writing to Will to use his influence to win the Admiral
to honour their roof by sleeping under it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have asked my Lady Hamilton,&rdquo; he
rejoined: &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the Ambassador&rsquo;s wife who orders where
the Admiral goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no disgrace; it is common courtesy, if you
wish to invite a guest who is staying with others, to do it
through his hostess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; she said briefly. &ldquo;It makes my blood boil
even to see him with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusidda!&rdquo; he cried protestingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you no eyes?&rdquo; she asked, in a voice that
was strangely, and it seemed to me unnecessarily, touched
with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course I have,&rdquo; he continued impatiently.
And neither saw that their words were double-edged.</p>

<p>And I, as I rumbled back in the heavy old coach past
the bridge of the Admiral George, thought myself mighty
clever, for I did not believe there was one word about the
Admiral in the letter; and the time sped even behind
those horses, as I thought how Will&rsquo;s stern face would
light up when he read what I took to be the real news in
that letter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXII.</span>&mdash;How all Europe
was at Sixes and Sevens.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T seems to me, who spent so important a part of my
life in those waters, that it would be difficult to find
a greater contrast under the same skies than that
presented by King Ferdinand&rsquo;s two kingdoms and two
capitals. Naples, as the Admiral said, is a city of fiddlers
and light-o&rsquo;-loves, utterly irresponsible; willing to begin a
war with a nation like France, without counting the cost;
marching to battle with the intention of turning her back
the moment the enemy stopped retreating and faced her;
willing to squander money that was needed for the very
existence of the kingdom on pasteboard decorations and
mythological <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>; willing to accept any strong master, as
Delilah accepted Samson, and from the very first thinking
how she might betray him.</p>

<p>But Naples is a lovely city, reposing serenely on one of
the world&rsquo;s most beautiful bays, surrounded by the most
perfect ruins of the everyday life of the ancient world, but
far enough off from the fiery mountain which first wrought
their ruin and then preserved them, (hermetically sealed in
lava, for the delight of people born two thousand years
later,) to regard it as a mere incident in the landscape, or
a curio for the amusement of the citizens and the attraction
of strangers.</p>

<p>Marvellous is the atmosphere in which Naples lives her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
lotus life: the blueness of the sky and sea are proverbial;
there are hills for breezy villas, and mountains for sanatoriums
all round; soft warm sea to bathe in, medicinal
springs to drink; and a soil that would grow anything,
to provide wine and oil and corn and fruit. While from the
other side of the lofty range of mountains, which guards
her health from the malaria, stretches the vast meadow
between the Apennines and the sea, where countless
flocks and herds wander round the eternal Temples of
Paestum.</p>

<p>Yes, Naples is a Delilah&mdash;a beautiful creature without
morals, without chasteness, without honour, but capable
of forgetting herself in soft love&mdash;a creature that loves
banqueting and excitement and lights and music and
flowers&mdash;a creature, in fact, typified by the merry music
which her light-hearted beggars play in her streets. And
as Naples is, so is her territory, except the grim Calabria,
which saved her in her hour of need.</p>

<p>But very different is Sicily, the beautiful slave, darkest
of the daughters of Europe, who has worn the fetters of
one master after another, sometimes after desperate resistance,
sometimes with calm submission to the inevitable,
but always with deep black hatred in her heart.</p>

<p>You can hardly be an hour in Sicily without feeling that
you are among a nation suffering from ancient and incurable
wrongs. There is something in the very physiognomy of
the Sicilians which suggests a spirit brooding over the
national curse.</p>

<p>The Sicilians are not courageous, but they are desperate.
The regiment of Highlanders which carried the day on the
Heights of Abraham, and so won Quebec and won Canada,
could defeat the whole population of Sicily on a level plain.
But the knowledge that they have this power, and that their
vengeance would come like an act of God on the following
day, would not deter a Sicilian from slaughtering stragglers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
An army of Sicilians would not stand for a moment against
the vehement bayonets and claymores; but the Sicilian
will always strike when he has the power, undeterred by
consequences.</p>

<p>And no less contrasted than kingdom with kingdom and
people with people, is capital with capital. There is no
light-hearted music in Palermo streets, save that which
comes from Naples. And the Sicilian is too grave and
dignified to chaffer or to make himself cheap or dear. And
with the Sicilian Delilah the story is not one of banqueting
and music, but one of wild passion and desperate
to-morrows.</p>

<p>It is not often that I find myself thinking such fine
thoughts as these; but I own that I was amazingly impressed
by the difference that the short sail between Naples
and Palermo made in the atmosphere of the Court and the
temperament of the Admiral. In fact, his whole nature
seemed to be changed from the time that he set foot on
what the chaplain says was called by the ancients &ldquo;the
Laughing Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wrote himself to Lady Parker, when they had been
but a day or two over the month at Palermo:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am worse than ever; my spirits have received such a shock
that I think they cannot recover it. You who remember me
always laughing and gay would hardly believe the change. But
who can see what I have and be well in health?&mdash;kingdoms lost
and a Royal Family in distress. But they are pleased to place
confidence in me; and whilst I live, and my services can be
useful to them, I shall never leave this country, although I know
that nothing but the air of England, and peace and quietness,
can perfectly restore me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We certainly landed under most distressing circumstances.
The Queen, who had the heart of a lion, and loved life as a
lovely woman should, was crushed by the death of her
little child, slain with the sea-sickness when within sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
land, which we could not make by reason of the wind.
And the Admiral was overcome by the casting down of all
hopes of concerted success against the hated French by the
cowardice of the Neapolitan counsels and army, and the
incompetence, if it were nothing worse, of General Mack.
The attitude, too, of My Lady but added to the situation.
This extraordinary woman, I verily believe, found something
fascinating in the universal air of gloom and tragedy.
To think that the Admiral was the centre of so much
peril and anxiety, and yet could be won from his woes
by the magic of her companionship, gratified her vanity,
which was one of the elements that counted much in her
character.</p>

<p>Not that she was either daunted, or willing to see great
issues lost while she consoled herself and him in a
theatrical Paradise. She had a profound faith in the man
she loved&mdash;her hero; and she felt sure that in the darkest
hour his genius would flash forth and strike the enemy
with lightning. Nor had she lost her gay, indomitable
heart. If she had thought that the right medicine for the
moment was to force cheerfulness, she would have used
the whole strength of her beauty and accomplishments and
brightness to try and inspire the Court. But she felt, I am
convinced, that tragedy was the keynote for the moment.
So tragedy it was.</p>

<p>To their Majesties was brought every day the news of
some fresh fragment of their kingdom having fallen away
from them, yielding like rotten wood to the touch of the
French. To the Admiral most days was brought some
fresh confirmation of his worst fears. The two points, for
instance, in which he was most interested, after the fate of
the Kingdom of Naples, were the capture of Malta and the
destruction of the transports at Alexandria, which had
taken the French to Egypt, and might bring them back
again when their fleet, preparing at Brest, should enter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
Mediterranean, form a junction with the Spaniards, and
engage ours.</p>

<p>At this distance of time, I remember well one morning,
when My Lady came on board with that radiant smile,
tempered to tender solicitude, at a moment when the
Admiral was almost fit to jump overboard under the
accumulation of unfavourable dispatches. Not one of the
Allies was doing what had been expected of them. One
even of his commanders was failing him.</p>

<p>I watched her cross the deck, full of grace and womanly
graciousness. I did not mind her calling me Tubby that
day: there was an air of affectionateness in her frank
greeting. I only conducted her to the Admiral&rsquo;s state-room
door, and there left her; but what passed I had from
his secretary, with whom he was too busily engaged to
dismiss him, as he was wont to dismiss any one when My
Lady came to him. For which, indeed, there was good
enough reason, for she seldom came to him alone in this
fashion except on a matter of import.</p>

<p>When she entered, the Admiral flew to her agitatedly:
&ldquo;Oh, my dear lady, my dear lady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, goodness me, what is the matter, Nelson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was so excited, that she was for the moment quite
oblivious of the secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; said the Admiral&mdash;&ldquo;matter! The matter is
England&mdash;their Majesties&mdash;the Emperor&mdash;Russia&mdash;the Bey&mdash;Malta&mdash;and
that infernal jumping monkey, Sir Sidney
Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French are all right, then?&rdquo; said My Lady, in
good-humoured sarcasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French!&rdquo; said the Admiral: &ldquo;they are robbers
and murderers&mdash;a band of thieves; and wars should
cease, and all the world should join in endeavouring
to extirpate from off the face of the earth this race
of murderers, oppressors, and unbelievers. Divine Providence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
never will permit these infidels to God to go
unpunished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have had thirty thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of palaces
and villas and goods of mine,&rdquo; observed My Lady philosophically,
and also perhaps to divert the Admiral&rsquo;s
thoughts into a new channel. &ldquo;But what of the rest of
the world, from which you seem to have been hearing
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad&mdash;bad&mdash;bad!&rdquo; he said, with his intense eye fixed
on some trifling object in his state-room, of whose very
outline he would be unconscious. &ldquo;Worst of all, perhaps,
the Emperor and these kingdoms,&mdash;though I cannot get
England to do what she might do. Ministers at home will
not see the importance of things here. They will not see
the importance of sending money; and it is as impossible
to squeeze money out of Sicily as it is to grow corn upon
a rock. Without money their Majesties cannot move, and
with money they would do nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nelson&mdash;the Queen!&rdquo; said My Lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her Majesty,&rdquo; said the Admiral, &ldquo;is a great king; she
is beautiful, she is adorable, she is royal-hearted. If it
were only Her Majesty, we should never have been where
we are now; but the King will act with Acton, or Acton
with the King, I don&rsquo;t know which, and the d&mdash;d one
of them will try and hunt with the hounds and run with
the hare, while the French are in the very act of hanging
him. What did they do at Leghorn?&mdash;treated me as
the master of a merchantman whose business it was to
transport the <em>brave</em> Neapolitan troops, and whose business
was then to kick up my heels till the <em>brave</em> Neapolitan
general had made up his mind to run away again! The
bonds of neutrality were to be drawn tight round the
English, who could and would save Naples, and to be
stretched in every direction the French, who meant to
swallow up Naples as soon as they were ready, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
choose; the King or Acton thinking that, by burying its
head in the sand, the ostrich would escape being kicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nelson,&rdquo; said My Lady, &ldquo;in common fairness to
the King, you must remember that neutrality with the
French had to be observed; and the Emperor was most
particular upon the point, that there must be nothing in
the nature of operations against them, except at Malta,
where they had dispossessed His Majesty of part of his
dominions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Emperor,&rdquo; said the Admiral, with withering
contempt: &ldquo;was there ever such a fool in a Paradise?
How is it that none of Her Majesty&rsquo;s wisdom and courage
has descended to her brother&rsquo;s son? While he is playing
with his precious scruples Naples will go, and the Great
Duchy will go, and all the Emperor&rsquo;s fine new Italian
dominions will go; and the day will come, mark my
words, Emma, when Buonaparte&mdash;should he ever get back
from Egypt&mdash;will enter Vienna in triumph and trample
on him in his own palace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is waiting for the Concert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Concert, forsooth!&mdash;there is no Concert, except
the Concert of the French themselves to take all Europe.
While the others are waiting for each other, the policy
of these robbers is to take the small States, which cannot
resist without the aid of the larger, and every one of them
will supply its quota of armies and resources to be used
against the larger, one by one, until they are all swallowed
by the Beast with the Ten Horns. Cannot the Emperor
see that the very life of his empire depends on his
marching the best army he can put in the field to Italy,
and clearing out the French? And as for the King and his
blessed neutrality&mdash;why, his neutrality was only an alliance
against England which prevented us destroying the whole
of the privateers in North Italy at one sweep; for they
all lay in the Mole at Leghorn, besides the corn-ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
which were waiting to carry the French supplies, without
which they could not maintain themselves a month in
Italy. And yet we could not touch one of them, because
the King was not at war with the French&mdash;the King who
at that moment was marching at the head of his army
against the French, in Rome, and who had already
captured from them the Island fortress of Gozo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you see what a difficult position he is placed
in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about me, Madam? Am I not placed in
a difficult position? Well, pass by the King&mdash;there is
Malta. Over and over again have I been assured that
Malta was just falling, and I do believe that if we could
land a few thousand regular troops the place would not hold
out long. The islanders are dead against the French; but
the islanders have no money or food, and hardly any arms,
but what we have given them. I have entreated Acton to send
if it is only ten thousand pounds worth of food. He answers
that the Treasury is empty, but the Queen herself has given
up seven thousand ounces, and this will do something. A
hundred thousand pounds spent in food now would save the
kingdom. And as for all those stories about the French being
on the eve of surrendering, they are sheer imagination.
The French know that, unless something is done, of the
two, Sicily is a great deal more likely to fall than Malta, and
it is their policy to wait and see what becomes of Sicily.
They know that Naples has fallen, long ago, and that there
is every chance of Messina following unless we can get some
British troops. And Mr. Duckworth will see that we don&rsquo;t
do that. One would imagine that Minorca was all Europe;
whereas Minorca is not fortified, and whoever has the
stronger fleet can always have it. The Maltese adore Ball;
they have made him a kind of Chief and President of their
Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Malta, at any rate, is right?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
&ldquo;No; what can he do? He can only blockade the
harbour to prevent provisions getting in, and that not very
successfully. Besides, the smallest French squadron could
make him draw off&mdash;he has so few English ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see to that, dear Nelson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Madam? I should not have sufficient ships to await
an action if the Brest fleet gets in the Mediterranean.
Some of my ships are at Alexandria, some at Malta, others
at Naples, Leghorn and Palermo. Alexandria ought to be
off my hands; the Russian and Turkish Admiral should
have been there some months ago. I ought not to need a
ship east of Kandia. These Russians mean no good; I
don&rsquo;t trust them. They are far more anxious to seize ports
in the Mediterranean for their own future use than to fight
the French. They have got Corfu, and they have their eye
on Malta, their excuse being that their Emperor is Grand
Master of St. John, elected by those rascally Knights, who
unlocked the gates of Valetta for the French&mdash;a place the
French could never have unlocked from the outside, even if
it had been empty. The Ottoman Admiral is sailing about
with the Russian, helping him to seize points, which will
afterwards be used against the Grand Signor. The good
Turk must look out, or he will find it cheaper to come to
terms with his enemy the French, rather than be sucked
dry by his ally the Russian. The Russian will never
be content until he has Constantinople, and as for the
French in this present war they may go hang. Russia is
too far off to have anything to fear for itself; and its
Emperor is only moving so as to fish in the troubled
waters. Otherwise they would have gone to Alexandria as
I have written, and entreated, over and over. They could
have what bombs and gun-vessels they want; and I fear
by this it is too late to destroy the shipping in Alexandria,
which the French have been steadily fortifying, while the
day after the Nile, with a handful of bombs and small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
craft, I could have destroyed the whole in a couple
of hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Sir Sidney Smith may do something. He is a
good officer, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a coxcomb and an impertinent rascal, though he
could be trusted to fight if he found himself in an action.
But he&rsquo;s cursed with an idea that he is a diplomatist, in
which he has unfortunately been encouraged by our foolish
Government, who have joined him in a commission with
his brother, the Minister at Constantinople, because he
knows a little of the Turk and his lingo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely that is an advantage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No advantage, Madam, when the jumping Jack has not
the sense or manners to keep his commission as a diplomatist,
and his commission as a captain under my orders
apart, but mixes them up in every dispatch, so much that
I ought not to read them, but tear them up for the most
insubordinate language ever addressed by a Captain to an
Admiral. You know that if there is one thing upon which
I have set my mind in the whole Mediterranean, it is this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you refer to&mdash;this is the very first
mention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That not one ship or soldier in that expedition should
ever be allowed to return to France. We have them boxed
up in Egypt, and we must keep them there. Well, this
jackanapes writes to me that he thinks it would be a good
thing to secure the evacuation of Egypt by granting them
passports back to France, if they promise to go at once&mdash;which
takes away the whole work of my victory of the Nile.
I have wrote him that I will not accept one of his passports,
and strictly forbidden him to enter into any convention
with the French. I have wrote to Lord St. Vincent and
Lord Spencer about him too. I shall go home if I am not
to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; says My Lady, &ldquo;that it is not because you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
are not trusted, but because Sir Sidney knows the language,
and may therefore be expected to hear more of what is
going on than if he had to depend on others for his hearsay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Languages are all right, but in a service like ours
discipline is first, and we are surrounded by treachery and
undermining on every side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court knows whom it can trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all the traitors in Europe, Asia, and Africa, are
not in Naples; though one might well be excused for
thinking so, seeing the numbers of these gentry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most double-dyed villain of them all is the Bey
of Tunis. For all these months I have kept the large fleet
of our only faithful ally, the Portuguese, from prosecuting
the war which is between Her Most Faithful Majesty and
the Bey; and he has repaid me by seizing ships carrying
my passports, and by sending ships with supplies to our
enemies, the French, shut up in Malta. He has, I hear
too, been entering into negotiations with the homicide,
Buonaparte, for helping him back to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall you do with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have wrote to Magra that I <em>will</em> have my passports
respected, and that, as I will do no wrong, I will suffer
none, and that I will sink every ship I find conveying
supplies to the enemy. But he is a double-dyed villain;
for when I sent the <i>Vanguard</i> there, he seized every
Frenchman and French vessel in the place, saying that it
was his part to do that. The which he released so soon as
the <i>Vanguard</i> departed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should make short work with the Bey. One can
only trust these Orientals when one does not need them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that would not do. It is my duty to protect
the Mussulmen from the infidel French. Besides, there are
traitors much nearer home than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
&ldquo;I mean either the Minister, or the Governors of
Syracuse and Messina. Malta might be further on by this,
if the corn, so often ordered to keep the Maltese from
starvation, had ever been sent. It has taken months to
get a cargo of corn from Sicily to Malta, which is almost
within sight, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any more &lsquo;ands&rsquo;? You are as gloomy as
a raven in a mist.&rdquo; This with her sweetest smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And worst of all, I hear rumours of the good St.
Vincent, our father, under whose fostering care we have
been led to fame, going home for ill-health at the moment
when the French are coming into the Mediterranean
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty morning&rsquo;s work! And what shall you do
about it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only pray to God that the faults of others may
press as heavily on the enemy as they press on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out with me, Nelson, to-night,&rdquo; she said, laying
her hand gently on his arm. &ldquo;All this can be grappled
with, but not by one in this anguish of mind. You must
brace yourself up to face things in your old light-hearted
way. You shall dine with me to-night, and bring Will
and the other; and we will drive on the Marina, and have
the new iced cream, and see the night service in the Palace
chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it will do me good. After I have wrote my
dispatches, there is nothing of all this that I can do, but
wait until my orders are obeyed. And I believe you that I
should go to work with a clearer mind and a better spirit.
I believe I have kept too much on my flagship during this
busy time. To tell you how dreary and uncomfortable
the <i>Vanguard</i> appears, is only to tell you what it is to go
from the pleasantest society to a solitary cell, or from the
dearest friends to no friends: I have been so perfectly
the <em>great</em> man&mdash;not a creature near me. From my heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
I wish myself the little man again! You and good Sir
William have spoiled me for any place but with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Lady was much gratified, but made nothing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any society will serve after a ship, Nelson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but I love you all&mdash;Mrs. Cadogan too. You
cannot conceive what I feel when I call you all to my
remembrance, as I stump up and down this room in
solitary grandeur, or with my secretary waiting to catch
my eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit it, then, naughty man; and be sure and dine with
us to-night, and bring the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIII.</span>&mdash;Of the Love
of the Admiral and My Lady.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU can rely that I, at any rate, was uncommonly
glad when the Admiral gave his orders that we
were to accompany him to My Lady&rsquo;s hospitable
table, for it had been mighty dull on board ship for a
long while past.</p>

<p>We had been kept very close&mdash;ready to move. Of course
we had none of the anxieties of the Admiral, but when
things are going ill the atmosphere of a whole ship will get
affected. And we could see that things had been going
mightily ill; and the talk was not of a merry fight, such as
we had had at the Nile, but of our being squeezed out of the
Mediterranean by the slowness and treachery and cowardice
and folly of one ally after another, and the coming of a
French fleet into the Mediterranean, and the Admiral being
unable to wait and fight it, because Commodore Duckworth
would not come down from Minorca. And the Admiral
had been miserably fretful and out of spirits, and more
sea-sick than we had ever known him. And Will, poor
fellow, had been ill at ease too, because of the non-furtherance
of his suit to Donna Rusidda, the meaning of whose continued
deafness he could not understand, because she ever
seemed well disposed to him, and glad to see him, and
gentle to his caresses. But of their marriage, which he and
her brother the Prince desired so earnestly, she would hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
nothing, though she was pleased to have him urge it with
the best force he could.</p>

<p>My Lady had a palace on the Marina, some way beyond
the palace of the Prince of Butera, the Sicilian noble who
had most influence with the Queen, and nearer to the Flora,
as they call the extraordinarily fine public garden, full of
various kinds of palms, and of fountains of white marble
shaded with the papyrus.</p>

<p>After we had dined, and the beautiful Sicilian summer
night had fallen, with the heavens so starlit that you could
make out the sapphire blueness of the sky, and with the air
soft as silk, we drove in the Embassy coaches up and down
the Marina, where it is the custom of the modish in Palermo
to assemble on warm nights. After a little we got down,
and went with the Admiral and My Lady to the kiosk,
where there was music, and all the <i>beau monde</i> eating what
they call in this part &ldquo;ices&rdquo;&mdash;a kind of cream iced and
flavoured with fruit, so shaped and coloured as to almost
exactly resemble the fruit from which it is flavoured.</p>

<p>Will was mightily offended by the <i>padrone</i>, who, perceiving
that he understood Italian, cautioned him not to be taken in
in the same way as some English sailor who had patronised
the kiosk, and, taking an ice orange for a veritable orange,
had bitten off half of it with the result of an outrageous
toothache, and a knock-down for the waiter.</p>

<p>Will did not say whether the cause of his dudgeon was
that he conceived the landlord to have confused him with a
common sailor, or because the landlord did not perceive at
a glance that he was one of those to whom it is an instinct
not to make a social mistake.</p>

<p>We found the confection, which was new to Englishmen,
very good; and I should be ashamed to say how many I
ate, for as the Admiral was enjoying the music and the
fluttering in of gay people to whom he had no need of
being presented, My Lady plied us with the iced cream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
as a kind of sop to our good-nature, for keeping us there
without consulting us. She had, as I suppose, some private
reason of her own.</p>

<p>Will had not the like appetite, but he kept an &ldquo;ice&rdquo; in
front of him and trifled with it; expecting momentarily,
though I know not why, to see the graceful form of Donna
Rusidda enter, with her brother the Prince. But she did
not come; and last of all our carriages were called, and we
drove up to the ten o&rsquo;clock service in the Palace chapel.
Since the death of the poor little prince in the passage from
Naples, Her Majesty had had services every morning and
evening at ten, and I know not how much oftener, celebrated
in her chapel, most of which she at first attended. But
she had too masterful a mind to continue thus for long,
when the air was so full of events; and consequently,
though the services were celebrated, the attendance grew
slender.</p>

<p>The Queen&rsquo;s mourning had also prevented us from
becoming familiar with the Palace, as we were at Naples.
Indeed, we had hardly been into it, except with messages
from the Admiral, which were generally received in a large
shabby chamber, hung with poor portraits of former Viceroys,
near the head of the red marble staircase which wound
round and round, three stories up, I think.</p>

<p>The Palace chapel is on the story below; and as it
possesses no exterior, but is merely as it were a hall in the
present Palace, whatever it may have been in the time of
that Norman Prince who built it; and as young naval
officers do not speak much of such matters, I was altogether
unprepared for the glory which burst upon us when we
pushed the leather-covered folding doors open and stepped
into a little <i>basilica</i>, I think they call it, full of the smell of
the sweetest incense, and very softly but perfectly lit with
huge silver lamps hung from the Arabic ceiling, and fed with
aromatic oil, which displayed to me what looked like a scene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
from the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo; The chapel had tall Moorish-looking
arches and walls covered with golden mosaics, and
a wondrously carved white marble candlestick as tall as two
or three men, and its floors and altar-parapet and lower
walls were made up of huge panels and pieces of rich
crimson porphyry divided with white marble, and the inlaid
mosaic borders they call the Cosmato. The quaint shapes,
the rich scents and colours almost stunned my senses; and
gorgeously robed priests, who seemed all white and jewels,
passed to and fro performing some solemn and beautiful
service, of which I could make nothing, but of which even
I, an irreverent young Protestant sailor, felt the holiness.
The music, too, was sweet and rich and pervading. I could
imagine any one who was stricken to the heart, as the poor
Queen had been in those first days, coming here for comfort.
It was so above the ordinary human, as to suggest ideas of
the presence of the Divine.</p>

<p>As soon as I could get over my astonishment, I noted
that there was nothing corresponding to our pews,&mdash;there
were but a few loose chairs, which those of the Palace,
high or low, who came in to worship, picked up and carried
where they would.</p>

<p>The Admiral motioned us to place some of these in the
shadow near the door, that, not being of the religion, we
might sit as unobtrusive as possible. The service which
had just begun was to last some half-hour, and My Lady
had told him that he should wait through it for the music.</p>

<p>When I got over my feeling of awe, I was a little disturbed
by what seemed to me the antics of the service:
the small boys dressed, as it seemed to my ignorant mind,
like so many small priests, who were for ever bringing
some book or robe or other article from the opposite
point of the chapel to where the priest was performing;
the tinkling of the little silver bells, which directed
sometimes the movements of the boys, sometimes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
worshippers (they seemed to know which without being
told); the swinging of censers; the changing of the robes
of the performing priest; and the breaking out of a sweet
clear intonation from some unsuspected corner.</p>

<p>But Will, as I have said, was not imaginative; and I
think in his soul, having been very well brought up by his
mother, he hated the whole thing as Popish. He would not
even be amused as I was at a confession that was going on
at the other side of the door from us, where a lady, evidently
of high rank, dressed in the hooded kind of mantle of black
silk not unlike a domino, common in Sicily, was pouring
out her heart, as we could tell by the sobs which shook her
slender figure, through the perforated panel of the confessional,
to a comfortable old priest, who was paying the
very slightest heed to her, and most of the time carrying on
with another priest a conversation which produced more
than one smile.</p>

<p>The lady, as she knelt on the broad steps of the confessional,
with her arms flung upwards, like the Magdalene
embracing the Cross, and the graceful line of her straight
young back carried along the fall of the rich mantle to
the floor at the foot of the steps, made a most charming
picture. I heard the Admiral tell My Lady that he had
quite lost his heart to the pretty sinner&mdash;a term by which
I feel sure he meant no irreverence, for it was not in the
nature of the Admiral to be irreverent to a woman; and,
least of all, to a woman in distress.</p>

<p>Presently the fair incognita rose; and casting, as even
the recently confessed will, an eye on the little group of
bright uniforms and My Lady&rsquo;s rich dress, gave such a
start that she almost fell. Perhaps it was faintness; at
any rate it displaced her hood, and we recognised Donna
Rusidda.</p>

<p>She made a step towards us, then suddenly turned, and
passed swiftly through the door. My Lady, knowing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
Will&rsquo;s attachment, which she believed to be reciprocated,
with the generous warmth characteristic of her, at once
got up, and made signs to Will that we were all going,
and that he should hasten and overtake the Princess.</p>

<p>Will was out in almost one bound over the polished
marble floor, but all trace of her had disappeared. She
had slipped into some door leading to the private
apartments.</p>

<p>My Lady&rsquo;s good-nature did not end here; for deeming
that Will would like to stay on the chance of the lady
returning, as ladies will who have a lover loitering, she
spoke to the officer who was for the night in command
of the central quadrangle and galleries, from which the
rooms of the Palace open off. He understood the situation
perfectly, and made Will free of the guard-room if he grew
tired of pacing.</p>

<p>Will generously invited me to remain with him, to
which of course I assented. But as I did it with a clear
understanding that I should have to betake myself to the
guard-room if he was successful, and not caring to keep
a watch in the Palace when I had so many to keep on
board ship, I retired into the guard-room at once. And as
the officer and I had no common language, I accepted the
offer, which he made me by signs, of his cloak, and lying
upon the couch pretended to go to sleep, which I very
soon did, but not before I had seen Will peep in and
ascertain if I was signalling patience.</p>

<p>What follows is of course from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal,
and it is curious how well the entry fits in, in every
respect, with our remembrance of that remarkable night,
which carries us exactly to the point where it begins.</p>

<p>After leaving us, it seems from his Journal that he and
My Lady drove down to the palace Sir William had taken
outside the southern end of the city, near the Flora.
Here, as at Naples, My Lady had given the Admiral the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
room which commanded the best view of the sea, knowing
how anxiously he scanned it with his glass.</p>


<p class="centerpad"><i>Extract from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal, March the &mdash;th, 1799.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never more struck with the difference between this
place and Naples than to-night. While I was there I had
such a feeling of elation; I could not open my windows
at night without hearing merry music, or looking out on
some illumination, and the twinkling lights of the moving
throng. It was one long hailing of my victory, until those
last few days when we were making preparations to save
Their Majesties. Everything was gay and bright, and
there was no taking of thought but for a happy morrow.
And when the moon shone down, as it is shining to-night, it
brought out such a varied scene, so full of life; while here
we have the same moon, only shining even more intensely,
bringing out not a point of life. There is no one driving
so far up the Marina; there is hardly a house near us; there
are no fishers in the Bay; my very ships, as well as the
town, are out of sight; and all the moon shows are the
low black arms of the Bay, and the melancholy mass of
Monte Pellegrino looming up like the coffin Ben Hallowell
brought me a few days since, made of the mainmast of the
<i>Orient</i>. They even grudge me dear Emma! Bluff Ben
gave me the coffin, as if it were to remind me that I was
mortal, and that all happiness was sinful, and suggest that I
sometimes dared to be happy for an hour; and Troubridge
is always urging me to be away from this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know, these captains, they don&rsquo;t know what
a life I have been leading, waiting here&mdash;the only central
point of the Mediterranean, where it is safe to have Their
Majesties&mdash;for one contrary and disheartening report after
another to reach me. If I were Commander-in-chief, with
plenty of ships to send where they were wanted, it would
be another thing; but it is only the bad seamanship of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
French which saves them from annihilating us. With a
force too great for us if we had all our fleet together, they
let us be scattered in threes and fours without falling on
us. But think of the anxiety of me, who am responsible!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet they would have it that I am doing nothing,
trifling away my time with Emma, because they knew
what hosts Sir William and she were at Naples, what <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>
and water-<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and banquets and balls and expeditions
to see antiquities they provided for us in one unending
stream. They should understand that there is nothing of
this here; that the Hamiltons are themselves but strangers
in the place, and that I am a prisoner to my secretary,
while the whole fate of the Mediterranean hangs on me. I
cannot tell how I should get through it all if it were not
for my good Emma, who is always equable, always cheerful,
and has such a soothing touch when I am worn out, body
and mind. Though, if I had had such a wife ... but
what if I had?&mdash;it would have been &lsquo;the uxorious Admiral
Nelson.&rsquo; With the fault-finding Troubridge, my <em>friend</em>
Troubridge, it would have been, &lsquo;What does Lord Nelson
want with his wife out here, when every minute may
mean action?&rsquo; There is no pleasing these people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dear good Emma is invaluable to me: she and dear
Sir William make a home for me, to which I can creep and
hide when I am done to death with worries. She will
deny me to people when they come to tell me the same
tale&mdash;it is always the same tale&mdash;that the Emperor, Acton,
the Russians, Sir Sidney Smith, the Bey, the Grand
Signor, they are all of them doing nothing or worse than
nothing, and Ball is helpless without even food from Sicily
for the Maltese. Why should I have to listen to them
every hour of the day? The Grand Signor is the best of
them, and he is a mule ridden by those crafty Russians,
who are playing the deep game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it to be wondered at that I sometimes try and escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
from all this? My ships are ready to sail at an hour&rsquo;s
notice, and I have written and written to Mr. Duckworth
to get him to quit Minorca, which leads to nothing, and
come to me, where there is a kingdom and the fate of
our fleet hanging in the balance. And yet they chide me
because I try and keep from breaking down by letting
Emma nurse my strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am miserably ill; we have none of us been well since
we came here. Perhaps the drainage washes back to the
Marina, for Palermo has a good repute. It would do me
good if I could see my ship from this window. I could
see it from the de Gregorio Palace, which I have taken and
use for a fleet office; but I am so lonely there&mdash;two miles
from my good friends. However, I think I must go there in
times like these. I am miserable without I see my ship.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>&ldquo;I broke off because I felt a hand upon my shoulder,
the hand that sends new blood through my wasted body,
which puts new heart into me; and, as I felt it, the very
Bay took on a new spirit. It was no longer a waste, but
had collected within its arms the deep peace of the Southern
night; and the moon shining down on Pellegrino changed
it till it looked like a crown, the crown on whose summit
the father of Hannibal defied the might of Rome those
three long years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, Nelson,&rsquo; said that clear voice, &lsquo;are you too
going to leave me? It is I who shall be lonely, for
there is word from Sir William that he must be at the
Palace to tell Acton nothing. The great Queen will not
herself see Acton, or suffer me to see him: he is all for
the King.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With that she began to weep very quietly&mdash;so quietly
that I did not know till a tear dropped on my hand. I
sought to comfort her, and we stood there I do not know
how long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I would to God,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;that the French would
come upon us: none of my ships would surrender, and if
they destroyed us all with their three to one, we should
so wing them that St. Vincent would catch them and finish
them, and then it would be all over for me, this worry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her arms wound round me; I could feel her soothing
lips; but she said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Admiralty do not trust me. They send this
coxcomb Smith to show that they do not think I have done
my best in the matter of destroying those transports at
Alexandria. The nation will do nothing for me&mdash;&pound;100,000
means so little for England, and &pound;100,000 worth of foodstuffs
would save a kingdom here. I have to bear the
brunt of it all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still she said nothing, but drew me closer to her, and
let me feel how her generous heart was beating for my
troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now my own captains think I might do more.
Troubridge, who is hipped, does not hesitate to tell me
so, as if I or any other man could do more anywhere.
They say you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she cried out, &lsquo;This moon blinds me: let us
move a little further into the room, and rest our eyes with
darkness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, I know not how long afterwards, I was overcome
by the magic of soft lips and the fragrance of a
woman&rsquo;s throat, and she had given me her whole heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a villain.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>&ldquo;But yet, now that I come to look back on it, with the
steady gaze of matured love, I cannot but think that this
villainy is a villainy invented of man&mdash;if it were not ordained
for his eternal punishment when he was driven out of the
Garden. It can have been no part of the original plan
that the holy consummation of love should only have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
intended for everyday use, like eating and drinking. Or
if it were, then surely, like eating and drinking, it should
have been freed from all conditions except immoderate
use. The one is as natural to the weak human body as
the other. Man cannot do without sleep, when he has
known the need for it. My brave fellows on the <i>Theseus</i>
went to sleep at the capstan-bars in my battle, at the
moment that they were trying to move the ship down
to conquer new enemies. They went to sleep in the act
of battle. I suppose if a man were starved of sleep
he would die, as if he were starved of food and drink.
And as with a man who has felt the imperious call of
sleep, so it is with a man who has felt the imperious
call of love. To some men it comes late: I have lived
forty years without it, but now that it has come, though
I know I must be a villain, I feel as if love were as much
part of my human nature as sleep, and I feel that life is
a great, lovely, glorious thing, and that life with love
is like winning a victory in which you do not let one
ship escape.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>More follows, under various dates, in the same strain:
in each one the note of fretfulness and ailing health being
in greater prominence. In the severe attacks of bodily
depression to which our beloved Admiral, in spite of his
great spirit, was so peculiarly liable, he could even doubt
Lord St. Vincent, and call Heaven to witness the ingratitude
of Captain Troubridge, though he was the best friend he
ever had except in the matter of regarding this great love
of the Admiral&rsquo;s from a somewhat narrow, uncharitable
view. And in this matter some allowance is to be made
for the Captain, who was one of the finest seamen who
ever entered the British Navy, though he had not the
imagination which made our Admiral the greatest of all
naval commanders. It was not having imagination which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
made him judge the Admiral hardly in this matter now,
though he regarded it much more gently afterwards.
To Captain Troubridge, then, My Lady was an adventuress.
He never thought that the love which ennobled her connection
with Mr. Greville might also ennoble her passion
for the Admiral; and he made no allowance for the rich
colours of the imagination with which the Admiral painted
My Lady&rsquo;s companionship and love, till it seemed to him
like the sunshine which makes the difference between the
winters of Naples and England.</p>

<p>I, for one, who was so much with our Admiral, would
stake my life on it that My Lady&rsquo;s companionship, her
lightly caressing hand on his arm or shoulder, the kiss of
good-fellowship which a daughter would give to a father,
meant much more to him than the passion for which their
lives have been branded. The Admiral&rsquo;s very physique was
one which craved for gentleness rather than passion. That
what the world reprobates did occur between them I take
to be the result of two things: firstly, that his delicate,
highly-strung constitution could not be in constant proximity
with the rich vitality of hers without gaining in vigour; and
secondly, that even with the best of men, as Shakespear
said, &ldquo;The sight of means to do ill deeds oft maketh ill
deeds done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>346]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIV.</span>&mdash;How the
Admiral went to the Favara,
and the Prophecy began its
Fulfilment.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR days past the Favara had been in a state of
ferment unknown for many years. The greatest
hero of the age, the man who was duelling with
Buonaparte for the safety or extinction of the world, and
had pinned the destroyer in Egypt, was to visit, to sleep
a night, at the ancient and decaying palace of the ancient
and decaying Norman House of the Princes of Favara. The
Admiral, with the considerateness which he extended to
the humblest sailor in his fleet, having ascertained from
Will the straitened fortunes of the House, had announced
his intention of coming in the most friendly way alone&mdash;an
announcement which, but for a certain circumstance,
might have given dire offence; for in Sicily you
must not notice poverty, you must allow yourself to be
deceived.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, the Admiral, attended
only by Will and myself, drove out in the afternoon to the
Favara, somewhat later than we had expected, because of a
most stormy interview, I should say desperate interview,
with my beautiful Lady, who, before us, hung round the
Admiral&rsquo;s neck, overwhelming him with the embraces
of a loving and solicitous woman, as she entreated him
not to go. She had heard, she said, rumours that certain
sympathisers of the French, disguised as brigands, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
take advantage of the loneliness of the Favara, and its
neighbourhood to the wild mountains, to assassinate him.
Yes, she had it on the best authority that they would
not even attempt to carry him off, conceiving that only by
his death could the French interests be served.</p>

<p>The risk to himself the Admiral, as ever, made light of;
indeed, he did not believe it, considering it but the subterfuge
of a woman who loved him, he knew how well, to keep
him at her beloved side during his last days at Palermo.
And since he loved her with all the strength of his mighty
soul, he was so far conquered by her tears and her caresses
that he pretended to be convinced and promised to consider
the matter, and if he should hear further, to make his
excuse to the Prince of Favara.</p>

<p>Great preparations were made for his arrival. I could
not count the servants in the Prince&rsquo;s magnificent but
tarnished liveries. They swarmed at the entrance, and
lined every stairway and gallery; and there were preparations
for a brilliant f&ecirc;te and illumination of the whole of the
vast and ancient fabric.</p>

<p>As we approached, a fine band, also in the livery of the
House, played English airs like &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; then new
to the Sicilies; and the Prince and Donna Rusidda, in
splendid Court dress, met us at the very entrance of the
grand salon, from which I noticed the famous silken hangings
had been stripped, leaving the polished porphyry and
the Cosmato work exposed, which at once struck the
Admiral&rsquo;s attention. He had hardly got through the formal
greetings before he commented on the splendour of the
apartment. Will and I exchanged glances, and knowing by
this time something of the country and of the straits of the
Prince, were not surprised when we found the bedroom set
apart for the Admiral in another part of the palace, which
we had not yet visited, decorated with these same silken
hangings, which had heretofore hung over the somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
cold porphyry walls of the grand salon. We recognised
further, in this chamber and the galleries approaching to it,
nearly every beautiful object which we had seen scattered
through the palace when we were chasing round it with
Donna Rusidda. We were much struck, at the same time,
with the fortress-like character of the place; for the lower
windows were all strongly enough barred to resist a military
assault, and entrance into the dwelling part there was
none except by the two great Arabic doorways set close
together on the inner side of the palace, one of which led
only to the uninhabited lower rooms rented as a storehouse
by the farmer, and the other opened directly into the small
portion used by the Prince and his sister, to which the only
access was by a narrow stairway walled-in to the ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; the Admiral began, when the Prince and his
sister had conducted him to his bed-chamber, for he was by
this sick with longing for the beloved society of My Lady,
&ldquo;I fear that I must leave when the other guests bid their
adieux this evening, as this is one of my last days in
Palermo. There are so many things that might demand
my attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Lord Nelson,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I entreat you no.
You have experienced officers who will have carried out all
your commands [which indeed was the case&mdash;T.&nbsp;T.], and to us
Sicilians there is a world of difference between the guest
who comes and goes, and the guest who lays his head for
only one night. Our poor house of the Favara is indeed
unworthy of such an honour from you, so much desired by
even the Queen herself; but we are an ancient race of the
same Norman blood as your own kings and nobles. We
are the oldest and purest Norman family in Sicily. We
have ever maintained the independent traditions of our race
towards the Church, and sorely suffered for it in estate.
Soon we shall have perished from off the face of the earth,
and there will be nothing left of the Princes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span>
Favara but a name; and we yearn to have it handed down
in Sicily, the land of traditions, as the last tradition of the
dead old race, that the great hero of the other Norman
kingdom so far away slept under our roof in token of
friendship and amity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the Admiral, as is well known, had the kindest
heart in the world, and he was touched by the anxiety and
race-pride of the beautiful young Princess. He would not
tell her My Lady&rsquo;s real reason for desiring him to return to
Palermo, conceiving, no doubt, that there would be no gainsaying
this. Indeed, he did not take the trouble either to
believe it or to care: he was always reckless of his personal
safety, and so no more was said of it. And the long sunny
afternoon and the evening with its brilliant <i>f&ecirc;te</i> passed
away, the guests leaving early, as they were of Palermo,
and the road had an evil repute at night. And with them
melted away the great army of servants, to return close
after dawn so that their absence should not be discovered
by the guest. They were not, as may be divined, servants
of the Prince, nor, many of them, servants at all, but from
the vineyards and lemon groves. In the houses of Sicilian
nobles, liveries are kept sometimes for centuries for
occasions like these.</p>

<p>Poor Will had been mightily crest-fallen all the afternoon
and evening, for his hostess had been so unremitting in her
attentions to the Admiral, who was by no means insensible
to her beauty and graciousness, and who was enjoying
the Sicilian dignity and repose, after the somewhat
foreign and noisy entertainments of the Queen in Naples.
And Will&rsquo;s mortification was increased when, at the time
of the departure of the other guests (when at last he had
expected to have a few words with Rusidda), the Admiral
bade us take word to My Lady about his spending the night
at the Favara. He intimated at the same time that we had
no need to return till the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>350]</a></span>
Now the chambers prepared for us, by the Admiral&rsquo;s, were
of the plainest description: there was little save a truckle-bed
standing on a tiled floor; but never in all his life had
any chamber seemed so beautiful to Will. He could only
remember that he was to sleep under the roof of his beloved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tubby,&rdquo; he said to me as soon as we were clear of the
house, &ldquo;do you mind coming back here with me when
we have delivered our message? I would give a year of
my life to sleep under this roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I agreed; and off we went to the city, to My
Lady&rsquo;s palace by the Flora, as hard as we could post, not
meeting any adventures by the way. Nor indeed were
we like to, except by reason of a horse bolting or a coach
losing its wheel; for there was a stream of guests returning
to Palermo.</p>

<p>But when we arrived at My Lady&rsquo;s, she put a very
different look upon the matter. Indeed, her lovely face was
streaming with tears in the agony of apprehension for the
man to whom she had given the whole of her passionate
heart. &ldquo;He will be killed!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;Nelson will be
killed! Oh! why did you leave him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she broke forth into a fresh passionate utterance:
&ldquo;What am I doing here, doing nothing, while he, with his
one arm, is fighting his last gasp for life? To the ship,
Will&mdash;off to the ship with you, and tell them that the
Admiral is being murdered out in the lonely house of the
Favara. No!&rdquo; she cried, suddenly rushing to the window
and screaming out something at the top of her rich voice:
&ldquo;spring into that coach which I have just stopped, and
drive to the Albergo La Fortuna. It is always full of your
officers later than this, and there will be coaches there.
Get them all into coaches, and stop here for a moment on
your way back, and I will have the pistols in the Embassy
ready for you, for your officers will only have their swords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her behaviour carried even Will away. He could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
force from his lips the question if she thought there was
any foundation for the report: her earnestness was so
terrible. We flew to the inn, and there we found a room
full of rollicking British officers, smoking and tossing off
the generous Sicilian wine, and most of them describing
some adventure or other, for the indulgence of which Sicily
offered great opportunities.</p>

<p>When Will burst in with the news every man leapt to
his feet and gripped his sword. As they dashed out of the
house one of them sang out to the landlord to put down the
reckoning to him&mdash;they used the house as a kind of club,
and were therefore well known by sight. Coaches were
hailed, and within a few minutes we were at the Ambassador&rsquo;s
house, and had pistols served to us. There
was, moreover, another coach waiting to join us, with the
English servants of the Embassy.</p>

<p>Out we raced to the Favara, escaping by some special
providence the perils of the road, which like most Sicilian
roads was of the very worst description, with its huge
ruts filled with loose stones, and the road itself barely
wide enough for a coach, and bordered by deep ditches.
But desperate men travel safely, and we were soon there.</p>


<p class="break">And here I must go to the Journal for an account of the
wonderful events which had been happening even during
our brief absence.</p>


<p class="centerpad"><i>Extract from the Journal, June the &mdash;th, 1799.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;After my Battles this has been the most extraordinary
twenty-four hours of my life. Yesterday I drove out with
Will and Trinder to a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> given in my honour by the
Prince of Favara, now much impoverished, but the head
of the chief Norman family in the Island, and therefore
very well disposed to the English. When I say Norman,
he was of course thoroughly Sicilian, as his family had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
been for centuries; but they are one of the few families
of undoubted Norman descent, and therefore, when all the
Two Sicilies are raving over their English protectors, feel
that they have a sort of claim of kinship. I went out
there, purposely, with no one from the ship beyond these
two young officers, wishing to spare them the expense
of entertaining the large company which goes when
the fleet accepts an invitation. Indeed, I did not think
seriously about staying overnight with them, having
promised the dear faithful Emma to return if it could be
managed, though she made it difficult for me by drawing
pictures of intended assaults by brigands, without remembering
how obstinate I am about flying from the face of
an enemy. However, my hostess made such a point
of it that I yielded; and when the guests left the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>,
somewhat early in the night, I packed Will and Trinder
with them to warn Emma that I should not be back.
She took my warning in a different way, fortunately for
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the interval I was like to have been kidnapped, or to
have lost my life: the latter, I hear, for Buonaparte has
been good enough to say that there is no safety for France
while I am alive, and people about whom he says such
things do not live long, when there are Frenchmen about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plan was for a body of Frenchisers, disguised as
brigands, to seize me while I was at the Favara, and carry
me off to the mountains, or kill me in event of resistance.
Which meant death. They had information that I should
spend the night there, and they knew that the attendants
at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> were, save a mere handful, not servants of the
Prince, but hired men, who would, with two exceptions
(one of whom was in their pay), put off their liveries and
depart with the guests. They were therefore few enough
to be overpowered, even if they were all roused; and it
might be possible to get to me unobserved by the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
the household, when the accomplice opened the door&mdash;for
my room lay in a distant part of the house. Information
reached them also that Will and Trinder, who were to have
slept in the ante-chamber of my suite, had been dispatched
by me back to Palermo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they had reckoned literally without their host, for
when they arrived, the Prince of Favara, who was a
very expert swordsman, had not retired. He was, it
appears, hunting through his heirlooms for an ancient
Norman seal with the arms of Tancredo di Mardolce, Prince
of Favara, to present to me in honour of my visit to him;
for the enormous iron chest, in which he kept such
things, was open, and with the seal was found a letter
which he had evidently just been writing in the most
honouring terms, begging my acceptance of &lsquo;this trifle,&rsquo;
and giving its history. The accomplice must have been a
stupid fellow, for instead of assuring himself that the Prince
had retired, he merely waited until he should have retired
by his usual habits. He then went down and opened the
wicket in the great oak door. But he had neglected to see
that the locks and hinges of this were oiled. The great
gates had been open all day, and when they were closed,
swung and locked easily. As, however, he opened the
wicket, either the lock or the hinges gave a great rusty jar
and startled the keen-eared Prince, who, hastening down
to learn the cause, met the brigands mounting the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had time to draw his sword, and posting himself on
the half-way landing, where a turn protected him from
pistol shots till his assailants were within a sword&rsquo;s length,
received their onset. One or two were quickly slain, and
the rest came on more cautiously. The Princess, who
behaved with extraordinary courage, hearing the clash of
steel, flew to him with his pistols, but seeing him engaged,
knew that to take off his attention by handing them to him
meant certain death. So with true Norman courage she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
stood at the head of the stair, waiting to do her part. The
stair was so narrow that she could not fire past him without
the danger of hitting him, though she did fire one of them
over his head to show him that she was there, and in the
hope of frightening the villains and rousing the servants.
But the servants, sleeping in the basement, were divided
from them by the brigands, and either did not hear or were
too cowardly to move&mdash;most likely the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she retreated up the stairs again, to stand at the
head and watch her brother killed unless some miracle
should save him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To rouse me was her first impulse. But here a
woman&rsquo;s devotion and instinct interfered. She had heard
the men shouting to her brother: &lsquo;Give up the Admiral
and you shall go unharmed&mdash;our quarrel is not with you.
We want his ransom.&rsquo; With a woman&rsquo;s swift wit she
divined that to call me was to play into their hands. I
had only one arm, and she knew that I should not have
brought pistols. She knew, too, that if she roused me I
could not be so cowardly as to make my escape while my
host was being killed for me; and she had hopes that, even
if they killed her and her brother, they might either not find
me, or that I might hear them tramping about for me and be
able to barricade myself, until assistance arrived, summoned
by the cowardly servants, who could be relied on to creep
out and run to the city gate, though they would not fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prince fought so well that her hopes rose for the
moment, and she almost trusted that he might beat the
assailants off for ever such a little time, when she could
have given him his pistols, and indeed the pair of them have
barricaded themselves behind the stout door at the head of
the staircase. But the villains were crafty, and two of them
charging up the stairs at once, one received her brother&rsquo;s
point, while the other fired his pistol right against the
Prince&rsquo;s heart, killing him on the spot. They then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
prepared to risk the remaining stairs; but the brave
Princess called out to them from her post round the corner,
that she had a pistol and would apply it to the first, in the
way in which they killed her brother. This checked their
ardour. They had been encouraged in their attack on the
Prince by having firearms, whilst he had none. But now
the case was changed: the first man up the steps would
certainly be killed, and none would be the first. And there
they stood, huddled on the stair, with beads of sweat
dropping off their foreheads as they wavered between fear
of a desperate woman and greed for the reward offered for
me&mdash;alive or dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently they determined to make a united rush, to
leave it uncertain who should be killed. And perhaps
only with the idea of daunting her, but I believe in cowardly
fiendishness, they swore with horrible imprecations to
revenge the death of the one who should fall with murder
and the worst outrages that could be perpetrated on a
woman. But the Princess did not waver, and up the stairs
they came, one paying the penalty of his life to her courage,
while the others flung themselves on her and tied her hands,
lest she should have another weapon. Then they gagged
her; and then, with the cruelty which is almost an instinct
with the lower-class Sicilians, they tied her feet together,
and forcing her on her knees, from which she could not in
her bonds rise, stood round her, waiting for her fears to
torture her, and forgetting me for a few moments, while
they gloated on a woman&rsquo;s terror and agony, and disputed
as to the outrages which should be inflicted on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While they stood thus, helter skelter up the marble
steps flew Will Hardres, followed by a dozen or more
English officers; and those who had taken counsel before
they would face a woman felt at their backs the vengeance
of the terrible English, who would have dashed into them
had they been ten to one. Their shrieks, the most appalling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>356]</a></span>
cries of terror that any of my officers present had ever
heard, rent the vaulted chamber of the ancient palace. The
next instant Will&rsquo;s eye fell on the Princess kneeling in her
bonds, and there was not another thought of mercy in his
soul, as with a fierce thrust through the back he reached
the heart of the captain of the band, and slashed off the
ear of the next as he dealt the deadly cut between the neck
and the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a few seconds but one of the gang was alive, and he
was saved by Hardy knocking up the sword that should have
ended his villainous career, in the hopes of extracting information.
At the same time Will jabbed him in the thigh with the
point of his sword, and bade him be quick with all he knew if
he wished to save his miserable life. In a surprisingly short
time he blabbed out the whole plot, which the Princess, who
had been freed by Will, had sufficient self-control to translate,
the Sicilian country dialect being beyond Will&rsquo;s powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, briefly, that they were to carry me off, for a
huge reward that was offered for me alive or dead. But
the significant part was that the reward for my dead body
was twice as much as that for the capture of my person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, all the while, was sleeping soundly in my distant
chamber, and the first intimation I had of it was when Donna
Rusidda fled to rouse me, closely followed by Will and a
fellow in the livery of the Ambassador, one of the coachful
who had come with my officers. When I opened my door
to their call and they came in, to my astonishment the fellow
in Sir William&rsquo;s liveries rushed in between, and fell on my
neck crying, &lsquo;Oh Nelson, Nelson, my hero! my hero!&rsquo; and
therewith fainted away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Emma, my incomparable Emma, who, knowing
of my danger, could not rest without accompanying my
rescuers; and doubtless, if there had been any such halting
among them as there had been among the murderers, her
lofty spirit would have leaped o&rsquo;er the delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>357]</a></span>
&ldquo;Meanwhile most of the party, finding that the danger
was no more, and leaving one or two to secure the prisoner,
flew to the Prince&rsquo;s side to see what could be done to save
his life; but in vain, for the villain had given him no
chance. The great heavily charged horse-pistol placed
so close to his body had actually blown away the clothes
and the flesh off his side, and laid bare the heart, in
which the slugs had buried themselves. Death had been
instantaneous. I must say that when I heard of it I was
never so moved; for there lay the last Prince of the ancient
House of the Favara, sword in hand, slain on his own
threshold, in defending a guest from the Island over the
seas, of whose Norman connection with himself he was
so greatly proud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The self-possession of the Princess was marvellous.
Mastering her grief and horror, though they were so
terribly wrote upon her countenance, she summoned the
cowardly rascals, who could have saved their master&rsquo;s
noble life, and made them bring all the couches and
bedding and cushions in the palace to the rooms surrounding
mine, also the remains of the lordly feast that her brother
had given in my honour, and the richest of their wines;
and then, bidding my officers feast and rest, excused herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Emma had the Prince&rsquo;s room assigned her, with
her own men guarding at the doors of herself and the
Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>Here follows an entry in the Journal which explains
an episode in the Admiral&rsquo;s life which we had never
been able wholly to understand until we read these lines,
and which went far to convince us, in spite of ourselves,
of the genuineness of these entries.</p>

<p>We both of us remember that morning well; indeed,
it would hardly be possible for the lapse of a lifetime to
efface the memory of that visit to the Favara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>358]</a></span>
The Admiral had sent the prisoner into Palermo, and
with him all the officers excepting Will and myself, who
were in personal attendance upon him. They were needed
for their ships, and now that the whole band was captured
or destroyed there was no necessity for their presence in
the house of sorrow.</p>

<p>We had just seen them off and mounted the steps; and,
as the Admiral told us that he did not require us, we went
out into the garden, where Will soon led the way into
the little shrine or belvedere where he had been with his
beloved Donna Rusidda. It gave him a pleasure to sit
there and, bidding me hold my tongue, revel in the scene
of that happy time. I, who had no associations to feed
on, after a little rose and went to the window, from whose
lattice one could command a view of the whole terrace,
at the end of which the belvedere stood. At the same
end of the terrace, only a few feet below the level of the
window, was a marble seat, shaped almost like a couch,
of the sort common in gardens of these parts. Presently
up the broad steps, which led to this terrace from the ilex
grove below, came the Admiral, walking thoughtfully, and
seated himself right below me. I thought it would be
vastly more entertaining to watch him than Will in his
present state, especially since I could see, and, very
naturally, what a prey to emotion he was. He could not
sit still, but walked swiftly backwards and forwards from
the seat to the balustrade a few feet in front of it, over
which one looked to the city and Pellegrino. While he
was pacing thus, a lady came up the steps enveloped
in one of the hooded black silk mantles common in so
many parts of Sicily. As she came near the Admiral
she let her hood fall back. It was Donna Rusidda; and
I was astonished to behold on her countenance not grief
but rapture. She came right up to the Admiral; and
something told me that what was about to happen was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>359]</a></span>
of so momentous a nature as to all but justify eavesdropping&mdash;and
eavesdropping it was, my continuing to
stand by that lattice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess, you have saved my life,&rdquo; he cried, advancing
to her with his arm outstretched in a way that suggested
the ghost of his lost arm stretched beside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Lord,&rdquo; she said (and I must not at this distance
of years attempt to reproduce her broken English), &ldquo;there
is no life to me so precious as yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral was a simple man, and evidently took her
declaration for the exquisite courtesy of the South, and
no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess, it is not right to speak thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your murdered brother&rsquo;s blood hardly yet dried
upon the threshold, I cannot bear to hear you: even a
compliment like that is treason to his memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, my Lord, it is no treason, for it is no compliment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral looked at her earnestly with his large
searching eye, which raked one like a broadside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand me. I am not speaking in
the flowery way of which you accuse us, but truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess, the women of your country have overwhelmed
me with their gratitude for the small services I have been
able to render it. I thank you&mdash;I thank you. It is nothing,
what I have been able to do for you. But how am I ever
to thank <em>you</em> for what you have done for me? It is not
twelve hours since you saved my life with your bravery.
I have none braver in my whole fleet. Princess, do not
talk of gratitude to me, me who have robbed you of a
brother; tell me rather how I can atone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you blind?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice I could
scarcely catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish I were, that I might forget last night&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>360]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, why are you blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited for her to explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not see yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that it is all because I love you!&mdash;not gratitude,
but love. I love you with my whole heart, my whole soul,
and every fibre of my body!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see tears glistening in the Admiral&rsquo;s eyes as he
said, &ldquo;Princess, this is madness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not madness,&rdquo; she said, coming forward and
kneeling at his feet, with her hands clasped round his arm,
and her great clear eyes and her flowerlike face turned
upwards, radiating love and beauty. In this attitude of
supplication she poured forth her love; speaking, not the
worship of the women of a people for the liberator of their
country, but a girl&rsquo;s passion for her first love.</p>

<p>I was so riveted by the tumult of emotions which struggled
in the Admiral&rsquo;s open face that I did not notice that I was
no longer alone at the lattice. My attitude had betrayed
that something extraordinary was in progress, and Will
was looking over my shoulder. I noticed the pressure, but
did not give him a thought while that wonderful tragedy
was being enacted below. The Admiral was strangely
moved, and could find no words except, &ldquo;But your brother,
Princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think of him; I cannot think of anything
except my love for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral gave a little gesture as if he would shake
her off; but, looking down on the lovely enraptured face,
he had not the heart. Instead, I could see the tears rolling
down his cheeks as he said, &ldquo;And your brother is hardly
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead! he is dead!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ruggiero
who was dearer to me than anything in life, except you.
Did I not wait for it? Did I not spare him? This has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
been upon my lips for months past, and I thought of
Ruggiero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess, Princess, do not speak it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, my dear Lord; more than anything should I
have been glad to die in Ruggiero&rsquo;s place if you had known
that I had died for you: nay, whether you knew it or no.
We Sicilians are afraid of pain, but not of death; and if
I had died for you, and you had known it, perhaps you
would have kissed my dead lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have kissed Ruggiero,&rdquo; said the Admiral, almost
involuntarily.</p>

<p>Whereat she fell to kissing his hand&mdash;a fountain of
passionate kisses. Then she rose and laid her hands upon
his shoulders and looked into his soul; and he, knowing
that his soul was as crystal to her, did not flinch, but rather
stood up, and she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord, hear the prayer of a woman, a prayer she
has often prayed to Heaven, a prayer for which she
had absolution the day that you were in the Queen&rsquo;s
chapel....&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a slight movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, stay and hear me out: hear of a woman&rsquo;s will,
oft challenged by herself, but steadfast. Desperate have I
been to give myself to you. I have thought and fought and
prayed how to find a way to conquer myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Princess, why not marry? Marry Will: you can
see how the boy is eating his heart out for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, quite simply; &ldquo;I love him much; I
could not be untrue to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Admiral hung his head as if <em>he</em> had said the
shameful thing. But she was not ashamed. She continued:
&ldquo;But now, since poor Ruggiero is dead, there is no
need. I am the last of my House. There is no one to be
hurt by me.&rdquo; Something seemed to flash across her as she
added: &ldquo;My uncle is very old, and at Syracuse they hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
nothing. So you see,&rdquo; she said, mistaking his silence,
&ldquo;there is nothing to part us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disengaged himself from her gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusidda,&rdquo; he said, letting those large sensitive lips
meet reverently on her forehead, &ldquo;this is the haven of
those who have made mistakes&mdash;not for the young with
all their life before them. I have enough to blame myself
for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, My Lady, who had sent to the city
for her proper habiliments, passed up the steps and stood
before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; she said. She was full of womanly
sympathy: no woman I ever knew could rise to such a
glory of sympathy and imagination and generosity at such
a moment. She led her away. It was My Lady who
wept over the death of the knightly Ruggiero and the
hopelessness of Rusidda&rsquo;s passion.</p>

<p>We watched them pass down the steps, and out of sight
among the ilexes, and the Admiral, very sorrowful, pass
by the steps from the far end of the terrace; and then I,
too, crept from the belvedere, in which I had been an
imprisoned spectator, and left Will with his head buried
in his arms.</p>

<p>The Admiral went to the body of the Prince, who was,
by this, laid out reverently on a bier in the small dark hall
at the top of the steps, where he had so valiantly met his
death for his guest. There he lay, as it were, still on guard,
where all who entered the palace must pass him. His
sword was at his side, and the old priest of S. Giovanni of
the Lepers, the priest who had brought him up from his
childhood, and so often repeated to him the prophecy of
the Favara, was praying over him. The Admiral made a
reverence to him as he entered, and taking the dead man&rsquo;s
right hand, held it as if he were taking a vow, with tears
splashing down on it. This the priest told us; and as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>363]</a></span>
passed up we saw for ourselves how the hero knelt by the
dead hero&rsquo;s body, praying&mdash;as all who knew the Admiral
would know&mdash;for the dead, though it is not permitted of
our Church. And the attendants told Will how the aged
servant of the Lord laid his hands and his blessing on the
heads of both.</p>

<p>The Admiral was still kneeling when I passed&mdash;kneeling
as I saw him kneel on the day of Trafalgar, when the
<i>Victory</i> was sailing so grandly into action.</p>

<p>My Lady, too, saw him from the door, and reverence
forbade her entering the chamber. And presently came
to her Will, inquiring for Donna Rusidda. She led him
to the porphyry chamber, where, dry-eyed and wild-eyed,
Donna Rusidda stood gazing out seawards, and there left
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusidda! Rusidda!&rdquo; called Will, waiting to see if she
would have him advance.</p>

<p>She came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must marry me now, dear one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her clear gaze on him. His face was
burning.</p>

<p>Then she knew that it could not be her loneliness, her
orphaned state, that made him press his suit at such a
time, and said, &ldquo;How could any man wish to marry
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, I heard all, and I wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, W-Will,&rdquo; she cried, letting herself be taken into his
arms, and weeping at last&mdash;&ldquo;how noble you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will marry me now?&rdquo; he said hopefully, after
the long silent embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I cannot. I love you too
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Rusidda, it cannot be true&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True it is, alas! I can never give my heart to
any one but him, and to him I have given it and shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
give it. I shall be his slave, to do what he lists. He
<em>shall</em> take me with him,&rdquo; she cried, with passionate
earnestness.</p>

<p>And then pitifulness smote her, for she knew well how
Will loved her, and what it was to love with such a love.
And she held her peace, for she could give Will no hope.
And so presently she passed into her own chamber.</p>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXV.</span>&mdash;How the Admiral
took Naples, and of the
Hanging of Caracciolo.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>IGHT glad were we when on June 24th, 1799, we
bore up to Naples and anchored in the Bay with
a noble fleet of eighteen sail of the line, which were
joined on the next day by two-and-twenty gun-and-mortar
vessels, that had been lying at the Islands. These sail of
the line for the most part had assembled off Maritimo, the
little island at the west point of Sicily, where the fate of a
Punic War was settled in the battle of the &AElig;gatian Islands,
so fatal to Carthage. Maritimo, the chaplain was careful
to impress upon us, was one of them. We left Palermo for
Naples the first time on June 13th, with the Hereditary
Prince on board to accompany the Admiral, and represent
his father at the imminent occupation of Naples. But that
evening of the 13th, at nine o&rsquo;clock, a lieutenant arrived
who had been landed westward of Palermo by the sloop of
war <i>Petrel</i>, which had not been able to beat up to the city
against the stiff easterly breeze, any more than we had been
able to get away from it. So that there was nothing for it
but to put back to Palermo on the 15th, land the Prince and
all the troops we had taken on board, and on to Maritimo,
whither the Admiral bade Captain Ball from Malta and
Captain Troubridge from Naples to join him with all their
ships. I believe the <i>Petrel</i> carried the orders to Captain
Ball to raise the Malta blockade; and to Naples, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>366]</a></span>
being no fear of the enemy, there was a constant run of
small craft. Our news was that the French had passed the
Straits, and been seen off Minorca&mdash;nineteen of the line.
On the 20th we had a despatch from Admiral Lord St.
Vincent that twelve British ships of the line had entered
the Straits from the Channel, and were standing for Mahon,
whence they would at once start off in search of Bruix,
who had disappeared. We learnt also that Lord Keith was
the new Commander-in-chief, Lord St. Vincent having
resigned.</p>

<p>The Admiral was convinced that Naples was the destination
of the French, and at once started to throw himself
upon them. He was equally convinced that no harm
would come to Sicily, with Keith&rsquo;s fine fleet in hot pursuit
of the French, and wrote to Sir William that he should be
back in eight days and to calm Her Majesty&rsquo;s distress. He
was his old self again, almost back to health, and full of
spirits at the prospect of meeting the French fleet. With
Admiral Lord Keith behind him to look after the future of
the two Kingdoms, he was ready to fight the French till
every ship he had was sunk.</p>

<p>We were off Palermo on the 21st, but did not enter
the harbour; we only lay to for a couple of hours, while
the Admiral went ashore to see Her Majesty and afterwards
brought Sir William and Lady Hamilton on board, the
latter with baggage. Nor could the Admiral&rsquo;s expectation
of finding the French fleet at Naples bring a shadow of
anxiety to her rosy, laughing face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the French are there, Nelson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there
will be another Nile, and we shall be there to see it
this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know if such a prospect had any particular
attraction for Sir William, but he did not show the white
feather. Possibly he thought that the French fleet would
be in no hurry to put themselves in a trap at Naples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span>
but that there might be need of a diplomatist who
understood the value of conflicting Neapolitan promises.
However, My Lady was all for a battle: a battle she
longed for, with her dear Admiral distributing thunderbolts.
Then we resumed our voyage, making Naples on
the 24th.</p>

<p>Off Ischia we had the news that put the Admiral into a
fury we were glad to see him in again. He did not make
the innocent suffer in his furies, and he had not had the
health for the like for months past. There was no French
fleet at Naples; and Cardinal Ruffo, who commanded
the Army of Vagabonds, the only people who were
worth anything in the Kingdom of Naples, had made a
most unintelligible treaty with the rebels, allowing them
Heaven knows what.</p>

<p>It was a strange voyage that. Here were we, eighteen
of the line, just outside the Bay, where we were in full
expectation of finding five-and-twenty of the French line.
We had not had a bulkhead in the ship for many weeks
past. Even the cabin occupied by Sir William and My
Lady was made of canvas screens; and yet when the boat
came aboard us off Ischia, here was this beautiful woman,
in the costly and delicate costume which befitted her as
a Court lady, standing beside the Admiral, who had gone
forward to receive the messenger. She certainly did say,
&ldquo;I will interpret for you,&rdquo; as a sort of explanation or
excuse for her presence. I, of course, was only in attendance
to take orders.</p>

<p>The Admiral first smiled, and was then very much
perturbed as she translated the message to him from the
Cardinal, which informed him that there were no French
or rebels, except in the castles and the citadel and one
or two unimportant fortified points. So far so good. But
the Cardinal went on to say that he had concluded a treaty
by which the patriots&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>368]</a></span>
&ldquo;Patriots!&rdquo; cried the Admiral. &ldquo;May he be d&mdash;d
with these vile homicidal rebels!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;by which the <em>rebels</em>,&rdquo; her Ladyship corrected herself,
&ldquo;were to evacuate the castles within twenty-one days
unless previously relieved by the French fleet; they
marching out with all the honours of war, and the British
Admiral providing vessels to take them to Toulon free of
all charge, and giving hostages to the French in the citadel
for the safe deliverance of the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty treaty!&rdquo; shouted the Admiral: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
Foote doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no news,&rdquo; continued My Lady, not heeding the
interruption, &ldquo;of the French fleet, so evacuation now only
waits the providing of suitable vessels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruffo hadn&rsquo;t the power,&rdquo; said the Admiral; &ldquo;it was
expressly reserved from him. I shall see to this; but I
suppose it&rsquo;s only another of their d&mdash;d scheming tricks.
Foote will have something to say to it. Troubridge has
wrote that the Governor of Procida is an honest man, etc.
I hope he may be. If he is, he is the only one in the two
kingdoms. Trinder, ask the captain to crowd on all sail,
and tell Mr. Vassall to signal it on to the fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently we swept once more between the Islands into
that glorious Bay which we had left under such inauspicious
circumstances. What a difference now! Then we were,
with a few Portugals and transports, helping the hapless
Court to fly for their lives; now we were eighteen of the
line, standing proudly in, the tack as we passed the Islands
giving us the favour of the breeze. Soon we were near
enough to hear from Captain Foote, who, on His Majesty&rsquo;s
frigate the <i>Sea-Horse</i>, had been commanding the gallant
little squadron of bombs and small craft which had been
maintaining the blockade since Captain Troubridge joined
us off Maritimo, to give us every available ship against the
overpowering force of the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>369]</a></span>
Captain Foote confirmed the Cardinal, and added that
though the evacuation had not yet begun he had vessels
nearly sufficient to take the evacuating force to Toulon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evacuating force!&rdquo; shouted the Admiral. &ldquo;By G&mdash;d,
they shall never evacuate, except as the unconditional
prisoners of His Sicilian Majesty!&rdquo; And Captain Troubridge,
who had come on board, and never concealed his
opinion for any man&mdash;indeed, we had seen but lately how
he had upbraided the Admiral himself&mdash;was quite agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trinder,&rdquo; said the Admiral, &ldquo;tell Mr. Vassall to signal
that the truce is at an end, and no one will be allowed
to leave the castles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, my Lord, the Cardinal considers
it a treaty, not a truce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cardinal may consider it what he chooses. Neither
he nor any man here had the power to make a treaty; and
the armistice, I take for granted, is, that if the French
and rebels are not relieved by their friends in twenty-one
days from the signing of the armistice, they shall evacuate
Naples, in this manner infamous to His Sicilian Majesty
and triumphant to them, as stated in the Article.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those in the castles, my Lord, are preparing to evacuate
in a day or two at the latest. They look upon it as a
treaty, not as an armistice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not make but an armistice, sir,&rdquo; said the
Admiral; &ldquo;and all armistices signify that either party may
renew hostilities, giving a certain notice fixed upon by the
contracting parties. In the present instance, I suppose the
Cardinal thought that in twenty-one days he had not the
power of driving the French from the Castle of St. Elmo,
or the rebels from the lower Castles of Uovo and Nuovo.
The French and rebels thought that if they could not be
relieved in twenty-one days they could, when unable to
remain any longer, covenant to be removed to a place
where they may be in a situation to renew their diabolical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
schemes against His Sicilian Majesty and the peace and
happiness of his faithful subjects. And their removal was
to be at the expense of His Majesty, and those enemies
and rebels were to be protected by the fleet of His
Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s faithful ally&mdash;the King of Great Britain.
Therefore, evidently, this agreement implies that both
parties are supposed to remain <i>in statu quo</i>; but if either
party receive relief from their situation, then the compact
of course falls to the ground, and is of no effect; for if one
party can be liberated from the agreement, it naturally
implies that the other is in the same state. And I fancy
the question need not be asked whether, if the French fleet
arrives this day in the Bay of Naples, the French and
rebels would adhere one moment to the armistice? &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
the French Admiral would say, &lsquo;I am not here to look on,
but to act.&rsquo; And so says the British Admiral; and declares
on his honour that the arrival of either fleet, British or
French, destroys the compact, for neither can lay idle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what am I to tell Captain Foote, my Lord? He
has to communicate with the Cardinal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him that the British Admiral proposes to the
Cardinal to send, in their joint names, to the French and
rebels, that the arrival of the British fleet has completely
destroyed the compact, as would that of the French if
they had had the power (which, thank God, they have
not!) to come to Naples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what measures is Captain Foote to take, my Lord?&mdash;or
I should say, What proclamation is he to deliver in
pursuance of your Lordship&rsquo;s orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him to send to the French in the citadel that they
shall give possession of the same citadel or Castle of
St. Elmo to His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s faithful subjects, and the
troops of his allies; on which condition alone they shall
be sent to France without the stipulation of their being
prisoners of war. That as to rebels and traitors, no power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>371]</a></span>
on earth has a right to stand between their gracious King
and them; they must instantly throw themselves on the
clemency of their Sovereign, for no other terms will be
allowed them; nor will the French be allowed even to
name them in any capitulation. If these terms are not
complied with, in the time above mentioned&mdash;namely, two
hours for the French, and instant submission on the part
of the rebels&mdash;such very favourable conditions will never
again be offered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening word came back that these orders had been
read and explained at great length to the Cardinal, and had
been rejected by him. Accordingly, the next morning we
ran right into the Bay, and anchored in close line-of-battle
before the city, at the same time calling up the two-and-twenty
gun-and-mortar vessels from the Islands to rest on
our flanks. After which the Admiral sent two summonses
to the Cardinal, to be by him delivered to the French in
the citadel and the rebels in the castles. From the first,
who had not treated in any way yet, he demanded an
unconditional surrender. His summons to the rebels
ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Ship <i>Foudroyant</i>,<br />
<span class="padrightsml">&ldquo;Naples Bay, 25th June, 1799.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson, K.B., Commander of His Britannic
Majesty&rsquo;s Fleet in the Bay of Naples, acquaints the rebellious
subjects of His Sicilian Majesty in the Castles of Uovo and
Nuovo, that he will not permit them to embark or quit those
places. They must surrender themselves to His Majesty&rsquo;s royal
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These summonses the Cardinal refused flat out to deliver.
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Admiral chose to break the armistice
between the signing and fulfilment of the capitulation, he
must do it by himself. The Calabrian army would assist
neither with guns nor with men. For himself, the Cardinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
was sick of the whole matter, and he should be pleased for
the Admiral to do what he liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There never was any doubt of the Admiral&rsquo;s doing what
he liked; for, unless he provided transports, there was no
means of evacuating the castles. To leave them on the
land side, when the <i>lazzaroni</i> had the countenance of the
English fleet, would mean being torn to pieces. As for
transports, no one could provide them but with the
Admiral&rsquo;s leave; and even then they would be under
the guns of the fleet.</p>

<p>The motives of the Cardinal have never been quite
fathomed. He had done the King good service by clearing
the rebels out of the places south of Naples, and out of
Naples itself save the castles, and up to this he had acted
like a straightforward, honest man; but what was his
thought now? &ldquo;Did he,&rdquo; as the Admiral said so bitterly,
&ldquo;think one house in Naples more to be prized than his
Sovereign&rsquo;s honour? Was he now engaged in the act of
collusion or treachery, to which every native subject of the
King seemed to come sooner or later? Or was he now
remembering his office in the Church, and anxious, even
to the manifest detriment of the Kingdom, to avert the
cruelties which the exasperated Loyalists of Naples would
be sure to wreak upon their beaten foes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was difficult not to feel sorry for these scoundrels.
The worst of them were, like the Prince Caracciolo, of the
principal nobility, and they had had to put up with treatment
from the French as bad as if they had been their enemies,
and not their friends. Men of the highest rank were
ordered to the long hours and exposure of the work of
common sentries, to save private soldiers in the army of
the French. They had also been stripped of their property
to keep the French going till they should have time to
capture the property of the Loyalists.</p>

<p>One thing is certain: that, of the Neapolitan Loyalists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>373]</a></span>
the Cardinal alone was for the carrying out of the arrangements
with the rebels which had been interrupted by
the arrival of our fleet. What the Admiral urged, that
Buonaparte would have considered such a treaty abrogated
by the arrival of an overwhelming force, is beyond dispute.
It is also beyond dispute that the Cardinal had not a man
of his own army with him in this matter. Only he,
and the commander of some Russian forces, who was
none too anxious to play into the hands of the British,
and Captain Foote, who had been cajoled into giving his
signature to that of which he did not approve, stood
for the treaty.</p>

<p>The next morning the Cardinal came on board himself,
and was received with proper ceremony and a salute of
thirteen guns. The interview, at which Sir William and
My Lady were present to interpret, lasted for hours; and
I have it from the Journal, which we have found so correct
wherever we had the opportunity of testing it by our own
private knowledge, that &ldquo;... the Cardinal and myself have
begun our career by a complete difference of opinion. <em>He</em>
will send the rebels to Toulon. <em>I</em> say they shall not go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We came very near high words,&rdquo; writes the Admiral. &ldquo;I
used every argument in my power to convince him that
the treaty and armistice was at an end by the arrival of
the fleet; and this the Cardinal had come with the
determination not to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cardinal went as he came. &ldquo;On the 27th,&rdquo; says
the Journal, &ldquo;the rebels came out of the castles as they
ought, and as, I hope, all those who are false to their King
and their country will, <em>to be hanged</em>, or otherwise disposed
of, as their Sovereign thought proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were placed in transports and brought under the
sterns of the men-of-war, where we could see the leaders&mdash;as
they were discovered by information&mdash;having irons put
on them to be brought for safe custody to one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>374]</a></span>
men-of-war. They were embarked altogether in fourteen
<i>polacres</i>, a kind of craft much used on the Italian coast.</p>

<p>In the matter of the capitulation the rebels clearly protracted
the negotiation for twenty-one days with the idea
that the French fleet would arrive and <i>ipso facto</i> cancel the
treaty. This provision was perfectly natural, for unless
the English fleet arrived, Captain Foote, with his weak
squadron, and the Cardinal, with his rough levies, had
hardly the means of reducing such strong places as the
Citadel and the Castles. Therefore, unless the English fleet
arrived, Captain Foote did well enough in getting such
strong places on terms. When the English fleet did arrive,
I have no doubt that what did actually happen was what
both French and rebels expected to happen. And if it had
not happened, they would have laughed at the simplicity
of the English in feeling bound by an arrangement which
no French commander would have entertained under the
circumstances. And neither Captain Foote nor the Cardinal
had any more power to conclude a treaty than a
serjeant commanding a picket of a regiment would have
to make arrangements binding on his Colonel. Moreover,
as the capitulation was not to take effect until the forts
were evacuated, and evacuation of the forts had not commenced
when the Admiral proclaimed the treaty at an end,
it never came into effect at all.</p>

<p>The same day the Admiral landed thirteen hundred men
from his own ships and those of Her Most Faithful Majesty
to besiege the French in St. Elmo, giving the command to
Captain Troubridge, and appointing second in command
Captain Ball of His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Alexander</i>, the same that
had had the command at Malta. With them went Will, of
which going I shall have much to say anon; but here I
shall go a little out of the order to describe an event which
has had far more importance conferred on it than it
deserved, by a malignant Opposition having made it their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>375]</a></span>
dagger to stab our great and good Admiral in the back. I
refer of course to the affair of Prince Caracciolo.</p>

<p>It was not more than nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the
29th, when a <i>barca</i> full of villainous-looking Calabrians&mdash;&ldquo;the
Christian Army&rdquo; they were called&mdash;pulled alongside.
In their midst was a short, thickset man, with his
hands bound behind him, in such rags, so emaciated, so
smothered in dirt, with his hair and beard so clotted, that
I did not at first recognise our old enemy of the Trattoria
at Resina.</p>

<p>These Christian Calabrians had found him hidden in a
cave. He had been one of the chief in authority in the
Castle of Uovo, until it became certain that the English
fleet was approaching and not the French, whereupon he
fled incontinently, knowing that our Admiral, though he
was in every other respect the most kind-hearted of men,
had only one recipe for mutineers&mdash;the yard-arm. But he
had reckoned without his host in thinking to get away.
The Calabrians, led by innumerable local chiefs, had really
fought very well in their advance up the Peninsula, though
it is true that they had not met many &ldquo;regulars&rdquo;; and now
that the approach of our fleet had paralysed the enemy,
they were engaged on a duty for which their training
thoroughly fitted them&mdash;the hunting-out of fugitives
skulking in the mountains, which is the whole history of
brigandage.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Hardy was informed who the prisoner
was, he was at once released from his bonds and conducted
to an officer&rsquo;s cabin, where he was given every means of
freshening his appearance, and had a proper meal, of which
he seemed in great want, placed before him. But of this he
refused to partake, showing a spirit in his last hours which
might have saved him and brought him great honour if he
had shown only a part of it at the beginning.</p>

<p>The Admiral at once issued the following order to Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>376]</a></span>
Thurn, Commodore and Commander of His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s
frigate <i>Minerva</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By Horatio Lord Nelson, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas Francisco Caracciolo, a Commodore in the service
of His Sicilian Majesty, has been taken, and stands accused of
rebellion against his lawful Sovereign, and for firing at his colours
hoisted on board his Frigate <i>The Minerva</i>, under your command:
You are, therefore, hereby required and directed to assemble five
of the senior officers under your command, yourself presiding,
and proceed to inquire whether the crime with which the said
Francisco Caracciolo stands charged, can be proved against
him; and if the charge is proved, you are to report to me what
punishment he ought to suffer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given on board the <i>Foudroyant</i>, Naples Bay, the 29th June,
1799.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nelson.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Court, assembling at once, sat from 10 a.m. till
noon. The charge was found proved, and the Admiral then
issued this second order to Count Thurn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By Horatio, Lord Nelson, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas a Board of Naval Officers of His Sicilian Majesty
hath been assembled to try Francisco Caracciolo for rebellion
against his lawful Sovereign, and for firing at His Sicilian
Majesty&rsquo;s Frigate <i>La Minerva</i>;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whereas the said Board of Naval Officers have found the
charge of rebellion fully proved against him, and have sentenced
the said Caracciolo to suffer death;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are hereby required and directed to cause the said
sentence of death to be carried into execution upon the said
Francisco Caracciolo accordingly, by hanging him at the fore
yard-arm of His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s Frigate <i>La Minerva</i>, under
your command, at five o&rsquo;clock this evening; and to cause him to
hang there until sunset, when you will have his body cut down,
and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given on board the <i>Foudroyant</i>, Naples Bay, the 29th of
June, 1799.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nelson.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>377]</a></span>
During all this time from the reception of the prisoner to
the carrying out of his sentence, which took roughly from
nine of the morning till five of the afternoon, the Admiral
remained in his state-room, closeted with certain of his
captains, and denying himself to all save those who came
to him on important military business, as when the officers
composing the Court Martial came to bring him their report.
My Lady was on the poop, as I have occasion to know, for
I was in attendance on her. Sir William remained in
his cabin. He had, I fancy, been thrown a good deal into
contact with the Prince, and was inexpressibly pained;
though, knowing him to be a double-dyed villain, it did not
seem possible for him to interfere.</p>

<p>My Lady too was very much affected: not that I think
she had any great liking for the Prince, for he was of a dour
disposition, but because she had a generous, sympathetic
woman&rsquo;s heart. Twice she attempted the Admiral&rsquo;s state-room,
but was denied by the sentry; and when Captain
Hardy came on the poop to give some order, she had a long
and earnest conversation with him, which I took to be
entreaty that he should carry her intercession to the
Admiral&mdash;and this though Caracciolo was the worst enemy
of the great Queen, for whom My Lady had such a
passionate attachment. Perhaps I am wrong in imagining
that she was interceding; but this I know, that she could
not have influenced the Admiral in the pronouncing of the
sentence, because she never saw him from the time that
Caracciolo was brought on board, which was before she had
left her cabin in the morning, until after the execution had
been carried out.</p>

<p>The Admiral has been much blamed for this same
execution of Caracciolo; though we who were present on
the fleet and, above all, those who were on the flagship,
do not see how, with the rules he had laid down for the
Service, he could have acted otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>378]</a></span>
It is most instructive and convincing to read what the
Journal says upon this much debated point. The Admiral
seems to have had either an instinct that the virulent
enemies to whom his success was such a disappointment
would fasten on this execution for what is called a &ldquo;cry&rdquo;;
or perhaps, and more probably, he is only recording the
struggle which he had with his own humane spirit.</p>

<p>After recounting the circumstances of his having been
brought on board, and of the ordering of his trial, and his
sentencing, and the carrying out of the sentence, with the
brevity of a ship&rsquo;s journal, he continues:&mdash;</p>


<p class="centerpad"><i>Extract from the Admiral&rsquo;s Journal, June 29th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much exercised over this matter of Caracciolo, but
I have done my duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If an English officer had behaved like Caracciolo&mdash;if,
for instance, Captain Foote, when left behind by Captain
Troubridge, on the latter&rsquo;s departure to Maritimo, had acted
as Caracciolo did and fired upon the English flag, or even
upon the flag of the Two Sicilies, could any one doubt that
I should have court-martialled him, and hung him on the
spot? Well, I am Commander-in-chief of the Two Sicilies
as well as the English here; and Caracciolo being a Sicilian
subject made this difference only: that I had him tried by
a Court Martial composed of Sicilians alone, not using my
authority as Commander-in-chief, except to declare the
verdict of the Court. So Caracciolo had in effect a further
chance to what an English officer would have had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this Caracciolo was a most double-dyed villain. Ever
one of the most disaffected nobles, he did accompany the
Royal Family in their flight from Naples to Palermo, as I
firmly believe, to see if he could carry the seeds of treason
from Naples to Sicily. Finding that the Sicilians, from
their hereditary hatred of the French, and because of the
continued presence of an English squadron, were not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>379]</a></span>
involved in the infamous Parthenopean Republic, he applied
to their Majesties for leave to return to Naples &lsquo;because
his property was in danger,&rsquo; As soon as he got there the
French relieved him of all his property, save his land (which
would have remained to him in any case had he continued
loyal), and subjected him to all the indignities of mounting
sentry and the like, which in their scorn and perfidy they
imposed upon the other traitors; and this they did out of
consideration for his being their ally and a good Republican,
instead of worse things, such as death or torture, which
they reserved for the Royalists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spite of these indignities he became an out-and-out
Frenchman, which men found so difficult to believe of a
Commodore in His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s Navy. Troubridge
himself wrote to me on April 18th: &lsquo;I enclose your
Lordship one of Caracciolo&rsquo;s letters as head of the Marine.
I hope he has been forced into this measure.... Caracciolo,
I am assured by all the sailors, <em>is not a Jacobin</em>, but forced
to act as he does. They sign his name to printed papers
without his authority, as they have, in my opinion, the
Archbishop&rsquo;s.&rsquo; That was on April 18th; but on May 1st
Troubridge wrote again: &lsquo;I am now satisfied that Caracciolo
is a Jacobin. I enclose you one of his letters. He
came in the gunboats to Castel-a-mare, himself, and spirited
up the Jacobins; though he seems to have had so much
conscience left that he saved Sorrento and Castel-a-mare
from being burnt, after they had been taken and plundered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all bad enough, but there was worse to follow.
For on the 28th of May Capt. Foote wrote to me: &lsquo;Caracciolo
threatens the second attack, and on the 13th his gunboats
annoyed the Royalist forces attacking the fort of Villema
and the bridge of Madelena a good deal.&rsquo; Caracciolo had
thus fired repeatedly upon his Sovereign&rsquo;s flag, and was
by everybody recognised as the Commander of the Rebel
Navy. His condemnation therefore was inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>380]</a></span>
&ldquo;I should not be surprised if some one were put up by an
enemy to ask why I ordered the sentence to be carried into
immediate execution. It may be said that there is no parallel
to be drawn between this and Admiral Lord St. Vincent&rsquo;s
instant execution of two seamen taken in the act of mutiny.
There was more than a parallel&mdash;there was necessity. The
situation, which has been blinked at by some, is that there are
in the Neapolitan State a vast number of persons neither
actively loyal nor actually indisposed to the Crown, whose
main idea is to save their skins and their own goods, and if
they can, get as much as possible of other people&rsquo;s. So far,
the lesson before these jackals has been that to be loyal
means exposing yourself to every kind of danger and
ignominy, and the almost certainty of being abandoned to
your enemies without a finger raised to save you or punish
evil doers; while if you are disloyal, though you may be
plundered and ill-treated by your new allies, you are not
in danger of death or torture, nor precluded from robbing,
maiming or slaying your private enemies. Every coward,
therefore, and that means a large proportion of the population
of Naples, feels bound to be a rebel; and the little risk
there might have been attached to rebellion is removed by
the treachery of the Royal commanders, who, having no
foreigners at their elbows, are indulging in the other
Neapolitan weakness of selling their country. All the way
along it is &lsquo;Heads, I win; Tails, you lose,&rsquo; against the
loyal, until the belief begins to grow that nothing serious
can happen to a rebel. It is to combat this feeling that I
dealt sharp swift justice to Caracciolo. I wish the rebels
to know that those who are caught red-handed will be
executed before they have time to buy their escapes; and
this effect I hope it will have, coupled with the proclamation
I have drawn up:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="addressr">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">&lsquo;Foudroyant,&rsquo; Naples Bay</span>, <i>29th June, 1799</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Horatio, Lord Nelson, Admiral of the British Fleet in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>381]</a></span>
Bay of Naples, gives notice to all those who have served as
officers, Civil or Military, in the service of the infamous Neapolitan
Republic, that if, in the space of twenty-four hours for
those who are in the City of Naples, and forty-eight hours for
those who are within five miles of it, they do not give themselves
up to the clemency of the King, to the Officer commanding the
Castles of Uovo and Nuovo, that Lord Nelson will consider them
still as in rebellion, and enemies of His Sicilian Majesty.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I was glad to see that the Prince had the honour not to
claim to be included in that infamous capitulation; for I
hear, by all accounts, that he was out of the Castle before
Foote signed at all. In his plea for mercy to the Duke of
Calviranno he rested his plea entirely on his former services,
without allusion to the capitulation; and though he showed
a brave man&rsquo;s firmness during his actual examination,
gaining thereby the esteem of such of my officers as were
present&mdash;the ward-room, as customary, being open to whoso
chose to enter&mdash;he made at least three attempts to throw
himself upon my mercy, which shows that he would
willingly have saved his life if he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the period between the passing of the sentence and its
carrying out, he was in the charge of Lieut. Parkinson
and a guard; and at his request Lieut. Parkinson came to
me first to demand a second trial, and afterwards that he
might be shot. I was much moved by the wording of his
second application: &lsquo;I am an old man, Sir,&rsquo; he said to
Lieut. Parkinson; &lsquo;I leave no family to lament my death&mdash;I
therefore cannot be supposed to be very anxious
about prolonging my life, but the disgrace of being hanged
is dreadful to me.&rsquo; Fortunately I remembered that the
excuse upon which he had obtained leave from the King to
return to Naples was that his property might not be confiscated
<em>and his family ruined</em>. I was therefore able to do
my duty and reply&mdash;&lsquo;Caracciolo has been fairly tried by
the officers of his own country; I cannot interfere.&rsquo; But he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>382]</a></span>
had so worked upon Lieut. Parkinson that, with a disregard
of etiquette for which I forgave him, he repeated Caracciolo&rsquo;s
request. I had some difficulty in doing my own duty and
bidding him&mdash;&lsquo;Go, Sir, and attend to your duty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caracciolo then, I am told, as a last hope, asked
Lieut. Parkinson whether he thought an application to Lady
Hamilton would be beneficial; upon which that officer went
to the quarter-deck, but I am thankful was not able to meet
with her. For this is what I dreaded. Dear Emma has such
a soft heart that, having known the Prince as a friend, even
his perfidy and wickedness to her beloved monarch might
not have been able to shut up her bowels of compassion.
For this reason I sat in my state-room with the door
guarded by a sentry, and would see none but my officers
until the sentence had been carried out. And I allowed
time for Caracciolo to be stone dead before I would see
Emma. From the hour that he was brought on board in
the morning, I could not trust myself with her tender heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing well the objection of a British Government to
its officers being mixed up with foreign executions, I nevertheless
gave orders for a Court Martial of Sicilian officers to
be assembled on this ship for the trial of Caracciolo, for
several reasons. In the first place, the good King had
made me his Commander-in-chief of the whole expedition or
campaign for the reconquest of Naples; and it therefore
fell on me to take the steps to show the rebels that leading
against their King would be visited with condign and
summary punishment. It was necessary that the trial
should take place, if anywhere, on a British ship, both for
the prisoner and for his King. For the prisoner, because
he had already been nigh torn to pieces by the Royalists,
maddened by their wrongs; and for the King, because no
Neapolitan, when left to himself, can be relied on not to
sell his country. As to the other reason advanced, for its
not being held on <i>La Minerva</i>&mdash;that it would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>383]</a></span>
dangerous to have ordered a Court Martial to assemble on
her, from the love which Sicilian seamen bore to Caracciolo,
and the fear of mutiny&mdash;it is not to be entertained, when
<i>La Minerva</i> was under the guns of a British ship. I am
convinced we had nothing but treachery to fear. Besides,
though the <i>Foudroyant</i> is a ship belonging to His Britannic
Majesty, it is also, for the time being, the seat of the
Neapolitan Government. To the prisoner, at all events,
trial on a British ship was an advantage, for where there
were a number of British officers with free access to the
trial, there could be no question of unfairness or violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prisoner, I am told, objected that Count Thurn, the
senior Sicilian officer, who presided over the trial, was his
personal enemy; which Count Thurn, as Commander of the
Sicilian Navy, could not fail to be to a rebel. And as Commander
of the Sicilian Navy it was impossible for him not
to preside at the Court Martial. None of my officers who
could speak Italian considered that Thurn showed the
slightest unfairness; they were all agreed that Caracciolo
bore himself well from the point of courage, but that his
answers were vague, and supported by no evidence whatever&mdash;the
last efforts of a man striving to save his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He claimed that he had been forced into the Republican
service, had been compelled to perform the duty of a
common soldier for a considerable time, when he was
offered the command of the Republican Neapolitan Navy,
<em>which necessity alone had at length compelled him to accept</em>.
But it was clearly demonstrated that he had enjoyed
opportunities of escaping, and on frequently being asked
why he had not embraced these opportunities, no satisfactory
reply was made. His silence on the point when
his life was at stake can only be attributed to his conviction
that he had no right whatever to claim protection from
the capitulation. In all circumstances men are likely to
be competent judges of what may best conduce to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>384]</a></span>
own safety; and it is perfectly incredible that, if Caracciolo
thought himself entitled to the benefit of the capitulation,
he would not have referred to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prisoner was charged with rebellion against his
lawful Sovereign, and for firing at his colours, hoisted on
board his frigate <i>The Minerva</i>. He stood further guilty
of killing and wounding the subjects, both of his own
Sovereign and His Britannic Majesty. When the court
was cleared and sentence of death passed on the prisoner,
it was duly transmitted to me by the President. I issued
the order for its being carried into execution on the same
evening at five, at which time he was removed from
the <i>Foudroyant</i> and hanged at the fore yard-arm of the
Neapolitan frigate <i>La Minerva</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was shocked for Caracciolo, not sorry, for he was a
traitor, and, as such, died the death. But that any man,
after living for seventy years and serving his country
faithfully (which here means only until temptation arises)
for forty of them, should from fear of death, or as he
confessed, from fear of the loss of property, turn traitor,
seems to me so terrible that I own that his being hanged
for it is less shocking to me than his offence.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">One more brief extract I must give from the Journal&mdash;the
last, I think, which will enter into this narrative from
these remarkable volumes. I give it because it was written
on the same night as the foregoing, and therefore goes to
prove that the Admiral regarded the execution of Caracciolo
as a plain ordinary duty upon which his mind was perfectly
made up. Which being over, he turned for relief to her
he loved best in the world, whose gracious sympathy
had so often been his haven of refuge when he was
overwrought.</p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;<i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;Since I wrote the above I have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>385]</a></span>
walking the deck under the beautiful Neapolitan night with
dear Emma. It makes one sad to think what these nights&mdash;as
beautiful as anything under Heaven&mdash;have seen.
To-night I would not think: I gave myself up to the
soothingness of her light hand within my arm; I have
no doubts now of the innocence and beneficence of this
friendship. Innocence does not signify abstinence, but
the absence of that which is bad for one. And how could
such a friendship be bad? The affection and sympathy
of a good woman are the best gifts that God bestows upon
man. To man it is appointed to go forth into the vineyard
to work, and to fight if need be, and woman is given to
him to make him a home. For a home lies not in the
four walls of a palace, or a cottage, but in the woman&rsquo;s
heart who makes of mere wood and stone an abode of
rest and happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXVI.</span>&mdash;Of the
strange Plight in which Will
found Katherine.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILL had the good fortune to be among the seamen
and marine forces landed under Captain Troubridge
to reduce the strong Citadel of St. Elmo,
which dominates all the city of Naples, and which, though
it had only five hundred French within it, rendered the
occupation of the said city, and the return of the King,
impracticable until it should be reduced.</p>

<p>The day after the execution of that long-time traitor
Caracciolo, we began operations in good earnest by mounting
the two heavy pieces on the landward side of the
Castle of Uovo, for the reduction of a battery and small
fort which stood on the summit of the highest rock on the
sea face of Naples, known as the Pizzofalcone&mdash;that being
necessary both for the safe occupation of the Castle of Uovo,
and because it was the best point for playing on the Citadel.
This was our first advance, and from that we won our way
a few yards at a time up the tremendous hill on which the
Castle of St. Elmo stands, as it were, right on the top of
the monastery of S. Martino.</p>

<p>The last position we carried was a little <i>fortalice</i> or
outwork on the brow of the hill; and we had not fired
above a few shots when they signalled to parley, and in
due time a Neapolitan officer appeared, for it was in the
hands of the Jacobins, and not of the French, who were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>387]</a></span>
within the Citadel. His message put Captain Troubridge
in rather a dilemma. He would have nothing but unconditional
surrender from rebels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty fine,&rdquo; said the Neapolitan, through Will;
&ldquo;but as we neither desire to take away our cannon nor our
ammunition, and should be well content to leave our small
arms with them, if it were not for the &lsquo;Christian army&rsquo;
who are scouring the country, hunting us down like wild
beasts, and not above torturing us when they find us, you
are hardly in a position to prevent us slipping away.
The only question is whether we are to have time to pack
the poor possessions which are all we have left between us
and starvation in these stormy times?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our commander assured him once more that it was not
in his power to accept anything but unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I make a suggestion, Signor Capitano?&rdquo; asked
the officer, who was a gentleman and of good family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot prevent that,&rdquo; said Captain Troubridge, rather
roughly, for he had an inborn mistrust of Neapolitans,
whom he hated nearly as badly as the French, I verily
believe for the change that had come over the Admiral at
Naples. Also he suspected the messenger of being, like
most of them, a wily coward who wished to come round
him with an oily tongue. He was one of the bravest men
that ever lived; and when it came to dealing with French
and Jacobins, who had been guilty of so many excesses in
cold blood, he wanted no parleying or treaties, but to lead
storming parties that asked and received no quarter. The
chicanery of the South Italians maddened and disgusted
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your permission, sir?&rdquo; said the officer, with
studied courtesy; and when our commander growled assent,
he simply said, &ldquo;On my honour as a gentleman, I would
advise you to fire past the fort from the moment the white
flag goes down until it is hoisted again, and then to send a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>388]</a></span>
party of occupation as fast as their legs can carry them;
and also to observe the little window to the left of the
passage leading up from the gate, which shall have a
handkerchief showing at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Troubridge had an eye for a true man, and
recognised that he was talking to one; so he replied: &ldquo;I
do not think that we shall be firing at your fort for the
next hour or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I for my part,&rdquo; rejoined the Neapolitan, &ldquo;can
assure you that if we perceive that, deeming us unworthy
of your newly mounted heavy ordnance, which could
reduce us to ashes in a few minutes, you are finding the
range for St. Elmo, no guns will be fired by us to provoke
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he took his leave; and though the grim
captain could not bring himself to pay the same marks
of respect to a rebel as he would to a proper enemy come
on such an errand, I could see his face soften when the
other&rsquo;s back was turned.</p>

<p>It was not an hour&mdash;though it seemed several&mdash;before
the white flag, which had been hauled down as soon as
the messenger regained the fort, ran up again; and instantly
the boarding party&mdash;for such in fact it was&mdash;dashed across
a kind of garden, which had at its end zigzag paths and
steps carved in the rock; the officer having as he went
out volunteered to show Will, who had acted as interpreter,
this short cut, telling him that it would be mighty important
for the occupying party not to lose a minute of time in
taking possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would willingly have told you more, sir,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;but I have some pride left in my misfortunes, and your
commander&rsquo;s attitude makes it impossible for me to
mention that which was the chief part of our terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By Captain Troubridge&rsquo;s leave, Will, who had no fear,
accompanied him alone, it being undesirable to draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>389]</a></span>
attention; nor was he in any great danger so long as he
was with the officer who had borne the flag of truce, or
afterwards, but from a chance musket-shot fired by some
rebel too insubordinate to obey his officers.</p>

<p>Even in the short while that Will was away the occupying
party had been formed, headed by Captain Troubridge
himself, who had divined from the brave officer&rsquo;s manner
that there was an affair of grave importance in the air.
The garrison kept their word about doing nothing to draw
our fire. Presently Will returned, and led the party to
the appointed place, where they were sheltered from
observation of the sentries by a little grove of orange
trees, and could yet see the flagstaff. As soon as the
white flag ran up, they dashed through one of the
ornamental gardens which the Italians fashion so quaintly
out of the sides of rocks, paying little heed, you may be
sure, to shrubs or statues, but with their eyes bent on
the breastwork at the top of the zigzag paths they had
to climb, from which they as good as expected a sharp
fusillade or a volley of boulders. But the officer had kept
his word, and they gained the breastwork uninjured, finding
its gate open. It was a very few yards from this to the
fort, where likewise they found the gate open and no
guards; but from which they could hear the sounds of
an angry tumult and one or two shots. Drawing pistols,
and gripping swords and cutlasses, they were led at a
rush up the steep slippery stone incline from the gate into
the interior of the fort; and there they came upon a mob
of Jacobins of the lower class who were battering at a door
and firing from time to time at a little window, fortunately
high up, from which was waving a handkerchief. In an
instant Captain Troubridge and Vassall and Will, who
were leading our column, were slashing among them,
driving straight for such as were armed with muskets or
pistols.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>390]</a></span>
The white flag, it will be remembered, was not in sign
of surrender, but in sign that the fort had been abandoned;
Captain Troubridge having refused to make any kind of
terms beyond the announcement that for such a space
of time he should not be firing in that direction; and the
officer having hinted plainly that he should not be able
to enforce the withdrawal of certain of his men.</p>

<p>In a very short space these men were all slain or had
laid down their arms; and then the sailors commenced
battering in the doors with a light brass gun which they
took off its carriage and slung in cords&mdash;an expedient which
had fortunately not occurred to the rebels, who, disarmed
and under guard, watched the operations sullenly.</p>

<p>No sooner had they delivered a batter or two, and a third
would have done the business, than they heard an English
voice from within&mdash;a gruff voice, which called&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi there! An English storming party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; shouted a dozen voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heads, then! the key is coming out of the window;&rdquo;
and out came a great rusty key above a foot long, which
looked as if it had been made for centuries; but the lock was
too battered for the key to turn, and the cry went back&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand clear while we stove the door in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Captain stopped them, and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You there, inside, is there room to stand clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said the gruff voice; and they thought it
must be a sailor, though they had no note of any captured
ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; rang out the Captain&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All together!&rdquo; The gun swung well back, and coming
against the door like a Roman battering-ram, carried away
the staple of the lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, my man, come out,&rdquo; said the Captain; but
his face suddenly changed in blank astonishment, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>391]</a></span>
drew himself up and saluted, as stump, stump, on the
stone flags came into view His Majesty&rsquo;s Admiral the Lord
Eastry; and even blanker was his astonishment when the
old Lord was followed by Katherine.</p>

<p>Her beautiful face was certainly anxious, but her healthy
cheeks were not blanched, and fear had not robbed her of
the uprightness of her carriage.</p>

<p>To her father death was a commonplace. He had faced
it times countless, when he had all his life before him; and
now it was near its end, and he had his dearest possession
to defend. He had, I noticed, a sword, and a pistol of
foreign make.</p>

<p>Captain Troubridge, having sent round search parties and
satisfied himself that there were no ambuscades, was
cheerily making his excuses for not recognising his lordship,
when the old Admiral called out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul, there&rsquo;s Will! Come here, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will had been very much &ldquo;on duty,&rdquo; for he was crushed
with shamefacedness before Katherine. He looked for
leave to the Captain, who with one of his great laughs said
that the Admiral was the senior officer present.</p>

<p>Will came forward, and the old man in his heartiness
did not note the ashamedness of Will&rsquo;s handshake. Will&rsquo;s
respectful silence was rather what you would have looked
for in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think I have here, Will?&mdash;here&rsquo;s Kitty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine came forward, perfectly self-possessed, and with
a gentle welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will, I am glad to see you. How thankful I shall
always be that you were one of our preservers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could have died for you,&rdquo; he cried, with passionate
earnestness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d rather you lived for her,&rdquo; grunted her father.</p>

<p>Will felt that he had no right to be so sure of this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; began Captain Troubridge, &ldquo;since you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>392]</a></span>
Lieutenant Hardres, I shall with your permission detail
him for attendance on you. I shall shortly, when my main
body arrives by the carriage road with the stores, have a
meal to offer you; and, judging by the dungeon in which
you have been confined, I expect you need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chamber they had lately quitted was certainly poor
accommodation for an old lord and a young lady; for it was
not a dozen feet long or much over half a dozen feet wide,
and was lighted only by a very small barred window near
the vaulted roof, and paved with dirty flagstones. It was
indeed a sort of strong store-room, generally used for provisions
of a less perishable kind, and a few barrels were
still about, on one of which Katherine had stood while she
was waving her handkerchief&mdash;the prearranged signal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty is as good as a boy, after all, Will,&rdquo; said his
Lordship, with the greatest pride, and to Will&rsquo;s pride too,
though he was so disconcerted. &ldquo;First she stood the fire
of the great guns lately mounted on your works down
there, and they knocked our feeble walls about to some
tune; and then she first held her handkerchief, and then
bound it to the bars under a dropping fire of musketry
from those gallant gentry you have out there. With my
legs you know I could no more reach the top of a barrel
than a masthead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will&rsquo;s eyes were full of pride and admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind telling me how you got here, my Lord?&rdquo;
asked Captain Troubridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d if I quite know, except how we got into
this last hole. We were put there as a favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A curious sort of favour,&rdquo; said Captain Troubridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we haven&rsquo;t been locked up here for a month on
the bread and water of affliction,&rdquo; retorted Katherine gaily.
&ldquo;The fact is, Captain Troubridge,&rdquo; she said, suddenly
growing serious, &ldquo;that our lives have been saved, and we
have been spared not only outrages but discomforts by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>393]</a></span>
chivalrousness of the gentleman who brought the flag of
truce to you; and I was hoping that you would have come
to terms with him, so that we could have informed you
in his presence of all he has done for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain was moved, but silent. He had obeyed
his orders; and it was not his way to throw the blame
on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell him the rest, father,&rdquo; said Katherine, a little
nettled, perhaps: &ldquo;people always suspect a woman of
putting a better or worse complexion on everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, d&mdash;n it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much to say,
except that at first every one hoped to be at war with the
French without the French knowing it, and then found
the French at war with him without his knowing it. And
that&rsquo;s how we were in for it. That miserable shilly-dallying
Emperor thought he could avoid war with the
the French, but he was only letting them choose their
own time; and when they chose it we were at Vienna,
for the doctors had recommended a change for Kitty.
How we were to get out of it was the puzzle, for the
French seemed to be everywhere between us and England.
We stayed on for weeks to find out; and last of all there
seemed no better way than to make our way to Trieste&mdash;that
was all through territory at present unoccupied by
the enemy&mdash;and take ship there for Naples (which we
were told had been recovered and was under the guns
of the British fleet); and from thence make our way to
England by the first of His Majesty&rsquo;s ships which was
going home. We did not attempt the Strait of Messina,
because there was no sea room to cut and run if we met
an enemy, and we gave Sicily a wide berth for the same
reason; and finally we made the Bay of Naples at the very
time when you had called the blockading squadron off to
Maritimo from the intelligence of the French fleet having
passed the Straits. There were a few small English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>394]</a></span>
craft patrolling, but in the thick weather we missed them,
and ran into the midst of Commodore Caracciolo&rsquo;s gunboats.
Fortunately we fell into the hands of the Count of Tanagra,
who came to see you this morning, a very brave and
chivalrous man reduced to a great state of hopelessness
from having been induced to embrace the pernicious
revolutionary doctrines of the wicked French by the frightful
abuses which have been going on in these kingdoms
unknown to their Majesties. But he has found that no
country in the world could be in so vile a state, under
the worst of kings, as under these robbers and murderers;
and he and the best of those with him would gladly have
left the French and rejoined their Majesties if they could
have come to terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Admiral&rsquo;s orders, my Lord, were most positive,
not to make any terms with the rebels but unconditional
surrender; and I think that anything but hanging is too
good for a man who fires upon his own flag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed, agreed,&rdquo; cried his Lordship. &ldquo;Agreed: I am
not the one to advance that when a king leaves his country
the inhabitants should ally themselves with the invaders,
though I am convinced that this Count of Tanagra, who is
a brave gentleman, honestly thought so. And as most of
these d&mdash;d little Italian states are for ever being taken by
a new master, there is something in his view of the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; said Troubridge. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they
fight like men, and maintain their independence against
all comers, instead of for ever betraying the weakening
power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you there; but it&rsquo;s just what they can&rsquo;t do.
These fellows have no fight in them, but when they
have a strong foreigner at their back. They are mere
camp-followers. The army has to be supplied from
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t worth thinking about, my Lord: the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>395]</a></span>
thing to do is to catch the traitors who have led them and
string them up; and I should like to tie every one of them
up to the gratings before I hung them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish something could be done for this Count of
Tanagra. He was a brave man, though misguided, and
could have brought the best of those who were with him
back to be faithful servants of the King; they have seen
too much of the French ever to want any more of them.
The first thing the French did was to strip their own
friends of nearly everything they possessed to satisfy the
greed of their soldiers, till they should have time to conquer
their enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t trust them, my Lord; you can&rsquo;t trust any
of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have pretty good reason for trusting this one. I
suspect we owe our lives to him; and he certainly saved
my daughter from the insults of the French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, the kindness of this gentleman knew no
bounds,&rdquo; burst in Katherine, &ldquo;for he kept us prisoners
for our own safety in his palace. He was living in his
own palace until the city was invested by the fleet; and
then, for our greater safety, he bore us first to one of
the castles, and, when they were bombarded, up to this
fortress&mdash;for the French would not have anything but
French in the Citadel itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right too,&rdquo; snorted out our Captain; &ldquo;a Neapolitan
would sell his own home to the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when he came down to you this morning he
was hoping to have made terms with you, by which he,
and those of his mind, could have returned to the service
of their Majesties, and kept us in safety until they were
strengthened by the forces from the ships. But since you
would grant no terms, and he had no mercy to hope from
those of the King&rsquo;s party to whom he was well known as
the most daring of the gunboat officers, he had to save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>396]</a></span>
himself and his comrades by marching out before you
came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, in the time of war we can only
deal with general rules, and not particular instances. I
am convinced that our great Admiral is right in proclaiming
no terms for the Jacobins, or in this land of liars there
would not be a rebel to hang in all Naples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> is no Jacobin,&rdquo; she said hotly. &ldquo;I have had many
conversations with him since I have been his prisoner.&rdquo;
(She had her Italian from Will&rsquo;s mother, which accounted
partly for another circumstance.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;he treated us with the
utmost consideration. We were his guests rather than his
prisoners, though indeed we were safer as the latter. He
even concealed from his men my rank in His Majesty&rsquo;s
service, which he had had from my daughter in conversation,
fearing that he might not be able to protect a British
Admiral, though it came near to being worse that I was
an English lord. For on the approach of Admiral Lord
Nelson and his fleet, when it became certain that the city
must fall, the common sort among his men, who are pure
brigands, announced their intention of carrying us off to
the mountains, and on the pain of death to me (which
would doubtless have been suggested by a present of my
cars) and selling my daughter to the French, extracting a
great ransom. To cut a long story short, and knowing the
unbending character of yourself and Nelson, we had many
conversations through my daughter, and the best that could
be done for us seemed to be that he should come to you
as he came, and in the event of failure should, after
warning you to take possession in the shortest possible
time, lock us up in the store-room where you found us,
pass the key in through the window, and endeavour to
frighten the baser sort of his men into flying with him,
without thought of us. But he warned us, in case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>397]</a></span>
accidents, not to attempt to let ourselves out until we
heard the voices of the English force, and then to show
a white handkerchief and parley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ho!&rdquo; ejaculated the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our precautions nearly cost us our liberty. The Count
had become extremely attached to my daughter, and she
was in such peril when these heavy guns of yours began to
play on this old cockleshell&mdash;though I must say she stood
fire like a man while it was being knocked to pieces over
our heads&mdash;that he begged you not to fire while he was
evacuating. This encouraged the brigands to steal back
again as soon as they had evacuated, and search the fort.
Fortunately for us they were some time in finding us, and
the door was very strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten, father, that he gave you back your
sword and one of his two pistols before he locked us up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that he did: a pistol for Kitty to use on them or
herself, and my sword that I might end as most of us Fleets
have ended; and, egad! I am glad that we were captured
to know what a daughter I have, for it has been a bitter
thing to me that the last of the Fleets should be a woman.
But the way she stood the cannonade, even that did not
come up to her conduct in the store-room. As soon as they
found us out and began their assault on the door, leaping
on a barrel she flew her white flag at the window. They
yelled out their &lsquo;<em>Buono! buono!</em>&rsquo; and bade us open. We
took no notice, and they became furious; and then first one
and then another fired at the flag she was holding. None
of the balls hit her, though she had some nasty cuts from
stone splinters; but the fire became so hot that she had to
tie the handkerchief to the bars, which she did without
further hurt, though they fired at her all the time she was
tying it. And then you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said our famous Captain Troubridge, unbuckling
his sword-belt, &ldquo;I hope I may be permitted&rdquo;;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>398]</a></span>
and with that he advanced to her and presented his
sword.</p>

<p>Katherine blushed with pleasure, and found a happy way
out of her embarrassment by passing the belt twice round
her own waist and getting the buckle to meet; while
Captain Troubridge put on the cutlass of one of our men,
the only one who had been hurt in the short <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>Then an escort was sent under Lieutenant Vassall&rsquo;s command&mdash;for
Will was in attendance on Admiral the Lord
Eastry&mdash;to conduct the rescued prisoners to the Castel dell&rsquo;
Uovo until word could be got off to the flagship about them.
They got there without mishap, though Will would have
been mighty glad to have changed places with Vassall.
He had no desire for conversation yet; and for guarding
Katherine, Vassall was quite sufficiently near.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Castle, Lord Eastry and his daughter were
conducted to the Governor&rsquo;s apartments, which had a flat
roof, where there was mounted a powerful glass beside our
lately added heavy ordnance.</p>

<p>What happened thereafter I had from Will, and have
heard with much more humour, since their happy marriage,
from Katherine. I don&rsquo;t know by what chance or design
his lordship stumped up to the roof alone&mdash;a difficult matter
for him; but certain it is that very soon after their arrival
Will found himself subjected to the severest fire of the
whole campaign in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Katherine.</p>

<p>Katherine came straight to him with both hands outstretched.
He took them, and held her at arms&rsquo; length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Will, aren&rsquo;t you going to kiss me? Is this what
the dying away of letters meant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hung his head, and did not speak for a little, while
Katherine in all the glory of her fairness regarded him in
a rather mystified, rather hurt, but wholly affectionate way,
instead of with offended pride, as he had hoped in his self-degradation.
Now that he saw his betrothed before him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>399]</a></span>
in her superb health, and with the pride natural to the
daughter and heir of a wealthy peer, tempered by honest
affection&mdash;now, while he had still burning in his brain the
remembrance, only an hour or two old, of the slim young
beauty showing under fire the courage of her sea-dog
forefathers&mdash;the image of poor Rusidda faded away. But
as the sweet Indian fruit leaves behind it an evil taste,
the infidelity to Katherine in having loved Rusidda left a
memory as bitter as wormwood.</p>

<p>At last he spoke. &ldquo;I am not fit to kiss you, Kitty Fleet:
I have been living for the love of another woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Will?&rdquo; she asked, with burning
cheeks. As he did not answer she continued, &ldquo;I suppose all
men are alike when they are long away, though I thought
you would have been disdainful of that. I think I can
forgive, though I am foolish enough to be disappointed. But
you will not see her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dead, poor soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death wipes out all debts, even of a life like hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray so,&rdquo; he said, and then, in his turn, fired up to
the roots of his hair. &ldquo;Kitty, is it possible that you could
have thought that of me?&rdquo; he asked, as a new light broke
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgave you; but oh, Will, I am glad it was not
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I think it was worse&mdash;I forgot you, and loved her
with all my heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine, as she has often told Cecilia, looked at Will, and
felt her heart soften. Will&rsquo;s mother had told her how
lightly their vows lay on Italian wives; and she felt how
Will&rsquo;s fair English face, with its beauty and its haughtiness
and its courageousness, must have appealed to such women.
She could imagine a tender, lovely wife, who in England
would have been beyond the reach of temptation&mdash;some
woman perhaps supremely lovable&mdash;yearning to youth so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>400]</a></span>
godlike, and she forgave her the wrong done to his betrothed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you bring her trouble, Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But once&mdash;with a sorry jest of proposing for her hand.&rdquo;
He told her of his escapade at Syracuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then she married some man she did not love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never, Kitty. But afterwards I longed for her
as my wife, and begged and prayed her, and tried with
my whole heart and strength to will her into marrying me.
For weeks and weeks I have lived for nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you failed because she was the Princess of Favara
and you only a lieutenant in His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, not that, Kitty. Rusidda loved me more than a
brother, and loved that I should love her; let me be with
her and caress her as much as I would; prayed that I
might make her love me enough to marry me,&mdash;to marry
me would have been to conquer herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did she not marry you? All the love in
life would have come afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not see, Kitty, that there was another, whom
she could not marry, and that it was from this passion that
she sought to save herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And could you not save her, Will?&rdquo; asked Katherine,
with a lump in her throat, and wondering how a passionate
woman could have resisted his suit.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did she die of shame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no shame&mdash;except my shame in having
lived for her pure caresses. She killed herself for love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What manner of man was he, this man, who took away
her eyes for you, Will? Was he of mighty stature, or
born to the mastery of women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a little plain man, with one eye and one arm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>401]</a></span>
who was born to the mastery of every man or woman who
ever came under his magic influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little man no bigger than Admiral Nelson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little man no bigger than the Admiral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did he know of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will told her of the interview we had involuntarily
witnessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say she is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the saddest of all. The Princes of Favara were
of the ancient family of Mardolce, so called from the
little lake of good water which was the most valued
possession of the Norman founder of their family&mdash;a mere
pond now. There was a prophecy that the last of the
race should perish through the love of a fair-haired stranger
from the North; and the sweetest woman of Sicily, the last
of her race, drowned herself in the Mardolce for love of
the Admiral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did every one know it?&mdash;had it become a scandal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; only he and My Lady, and Trinder, who sent me
up word, knew of the cause, when the news was brought
to the flagship by the <i>Sirena</i> from Palermo yesterday. She
had, it seems, begged the Admiral to bring her in the
<i>Foudroyant</i> with the Hamiltons, when he left Palermo for
Naples two or three weeks since; and, when he refused,
she humbled her pride and begged my Lady Hamilton,
whom she hated, as her worst enemy, and despised, to
intercede for her. My Lady is generous, and used her
utmost entreaties&mdash;though she knew the reason&mdash;but in
vain; and the next day after we sailed poor Rusidda was
found in the Mardolce,&rdquo; replied Will, very white.</p>

<p>Presently, when he had recovered himself a little,
Katherine, who had heard no rumours, asked, &ldquo;And Lady
Hamilton&mdash;what of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>402]</a></span>
To which Will replied stoutly, &ldquo;The Admiral loves
her,&rdquo; and from that he would not be budged.</p>

<p>While Katherine had been questioning him of Donna
Rusidda and the Admiral, Will had forgotten his ashamedness
a little, and no longer held her at arms&rsquo; length, but
by the hands loosely.</p>

<p>By the slightest movement, she was holding his hands,
instead of he hers. But the movement was full of
consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will,&rdquo; she said, forcing him to raise responding eyes,
&ldquo;do you love me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all the strength of shame, Kitty, and before
everything in the world. But can you forgive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t kissed me yet, Will!&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">I will not write down what Katherine said when,
loverlike, he insisted upon going over all his iniquities
again, to be forgiven in detail. For all her life was a
forgiveness. And how wisely the wench did, for with
whom could she have known such proud happiness as
with Will? He has had eyes for no other woman since&mdash;not
even for their lovely daughter, who is by just a look
of her father the more regal of the two women.</p>

<p>And she&mdash;she has had the greatest pride that life can
give a woman: the double knowledge that she does not
fear the proud, grim, masterful man whom one can hardly
meet without being daunted, she who has to face him in
all his moods, and to stand between him and his wrath;
and that though they have been married these twenty
years, her favour is of such moment to him that he will
pause in his anger to win a gracious look.</p>

<p>I could fill another book with the stories of the neighbours
about the noble fashion in which Katherine comforted
herself during Will&rsquo;s long absences at sea for years after
this; of the gaiety of heart and graciousness which she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>403]</a></span>
maintained with a spotless reputation. It was in those
years, through ten of their dozen, that she was in London,
one of the rulers of society, and the most courted of women,
keeping house with Will&rsquo;s mother for her father. But
when her father died she went down to Eastry to mourn
him, nor ever came to London again without her husband.</p>

<p>In the year 1817 his own dear mother, who in the
midst of her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s triumphs had remained as
simple and quietly beautiful as a Kentish primrose, died
in Will&rsquo;s arms, a week or so after he had homed from one
his cruises; and Will, having compassion on Katherine&rsquo;s
widowed state, and having himself made a goodly fortune
out of prize money, in addition to the great fortune they
had of her father, retired to their mansion-house of Eastry,
where we were sitting that morning when we were brought
that wonderful Journal of the Admiral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>404]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXVII.</span>&mdash;Of the Death
of Donna Rusidda, the Resurrection
of Caracciolo, and the Happy
Ending.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE 12th of July, 1799, is a day I can never forget, for
on it happened two events, one shocking and one
surprising, to the last degree.</p>

<p>The Admiral had gone to bed the night before more
dejected than I ever knew him; for though he had had the
honour to receive His Majesty on board, and the executive
officers of the Government, to take up their official residence
there, until such time as St. Elmo should have fallen and
Naples be safe again for the Royal presence, he was terribly
cast down by a piece of news which came by the same frigate
that had brought His Majesty, and which I found the means
to send on to Will. The Queen had not been suffered to
accompany the King. That great Sovereign was left to eat
her heart out in disgrace, nominally for the misfortunes into
which her headlong recourse to arms in the November
before had plunged her kingdom, really because General
Acton, who accompanied His Majesty, found that by using
the King as a tool against her he himself had the ruling of
the kingdom instead of taking his orders from her.</p>

<p>It was thought very strange that one of the Queen&rsquo;s
ladies&mdash;the Princess of Favara, Donna Rusidda&mdash;should
make urgent and repeated applications to accompany the
Court to Naples, though Her Majesty was not suffered to
go. Her applications were consequently refused, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>405]</a></span>
convoy, guarded by His Majesty&rsquo;s frigate the <i>Sea-Horse</i>,
Captain Foote; and His Sicilian Majesty&rsquo;s frigate the <i>Sirena</i>,
which had the King on board, started without her. But
since convoys sail very slowly, they were overtaken by a
light vessel, with some despatches for His Majesty; and
with the despatches came the melancholy news that the
Princess had been found dead in the Mardolce lake. The
business of receiving the Court on board was over, and I
was standing in attendance on the Admiral, when up comes
My Lady, evidently with something grave on her mind. I
was about to take my leave when the Admiral motioned
me to stay. Indeed, privacy on the flagship there was
none to be had, except by turning the King out of the
Admiral&rsquo;s state-room. What with the Court and its
hangers-on, and officers from the squadron with various
business, the ship had about double her complement on
board, though at bedtime they grew a little less from the
sheer want of room to lie down. It was evening, but we
were close to a lantern, whose light fell on the faces of My
Lady and the Admiral, though so little on mine that perhaps
they forgot me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; began My Lady, with blunt words but the
gentlest and most engaging manner, &ldquo;were you in love
with little Rusidda, that I came upon with you that day at
the Favara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest Emma, I never loved any but you&mdash;not even,
as I know now, Lady Nelson. I never knew what perfect
friendship and sympathy was until I met your noble heart,
which has filled up all my heart, leaving no space for
anything unless it were a child of yours&mdash;flesh of your
flesh&mdash;if you had one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; cried My Lady, with generous quickness,
&ldquo;though I saw your lips upon her forehead, and though
she poured her whole heart out to me, poor little thing,
when she was begging to be brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>406]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can swear it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by all that is most holy to
me: by my hopes for my country&mdash;by anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not jealous,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you can be a better lover
than I saw then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not love her,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;though I think she is a
sweet, beautiful, gracious, noble woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I know how she loved you,&rdquo; said My Lady, &ldquo;for
she confessed, and that is why I entreated her to be
brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see that she was in a way jealous, for every look
as it were, every little gesture while she was questioning
him, had been in the nature of a caress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was the purest kind of hero-worship, though
she besought me to receive her love&mdash;that is to say if I am
a hero, and I am sure I doubt it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oblivious of my very existence, My Lady flung her arms
round him, and wooed him with those lovely lips, crying
&ldquo;My king of heroes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she murmured again&mdash;&ldquo;Poor little Rusidda! what
a brave, true woman, and the best I think in Sicily!&rdquo; Then
she added aloud, &ldquo;You are not afraid of death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of my own death,&rdquo; he said, and truly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen it in a hundred forms; you have seen
your most faithful friends and servants&mdash;a handful at a
time, perhaps...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see his hand tighten round hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a sad coward at that, dearest Emma: I have wept
in the midst of victory at a comrade&rsquo;s falling beside me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Nelson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have need of all your
courage now, for the woman who broke her heart for you
is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he gasped, almost falling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Do you not remember her
saying, &lsquo;We Sicilians fear pain, but not death&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>407]</a></span>
I do not think I ever saw such a well of silent grief, even
in a woman, as there was then in the Admiral for Donna
Rusidda. Certain I am that if the spirits of the late
departed hover round those they love best on earth, the
spirit of Donna Rusidda craved no other monument than
those great tears which splashed down on the quarter-deck
of the old <i>Foudroyant</i>.</p>


<p class="break">And here I may be permitted to digress to say what I
saw when, years and years later, Will and Katherine, and
my wife&mdash;Will&rsquo;s veritable sister, a more imperious but
sweeter Will&mdash;journeyed to Sicily, a trip on I forget what
excuse, the reality being that my wife had a trouble, happily
passed, with her lungs, which made Will carry us all off
travelling <i>en prince</i>, to the serene skies of Palermo. The
first thing we did&mdash;it was Katherine suggested it, thinking
it must be uppermost in Will&rsquo;s heart, and that he, who was
still so madly her lover, might hesitate to speak about the
other woman&mdash;was to ask where we could find Donna
Rusidda&rsquo;s grave.</p>

<p>Can it be believed? The landlord of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
Hotel,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the best in Palermo, was unable to identify the
Princess with herself. But on the Sunday a band was playing
in the Flora, and we, who had been visiting the palace in
which our beloved Admiral had spent so much of his time
with the Hamiltons, were drawn to the music in a listless
way, and found the crowd collected between the cupola from
which the music proceeded and a fountain of white marble
in the present Sicilian taste, which is not to be commended,
though its parts may be beautiful. It consisted of an oval
basin, perhaps a dozen feet across, with various aquatic
plants growing in it; and in their midst, with only the head
and part of the shoulders out of the water, a carving of a
drowned woman with an exquisitely lovely face. And at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>408]</a></span>
one end of the fountain was a column with a broken lyre
hanging to it, also of white marble, on which was carved in
gold letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rosalia di Mardolce, Princess of Favara. The last
fruit of a dry tree.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a></span>
Now the Hotel de France.</p>
</div>

<p>Will questioned the people who were about the fountain,
such of them as understood Italian. None of them knew
much of her, and one and all were under the belief that she
was called Rosalia of the Mardolce because she was found
drowned in it, and not because it was her name. The
Favara, he learned, had fallen hopelessly into decay, and
was now merely a storehouse of the farmer who rented
the land. And though every woman and child in Palermo
knew that the beautiful lady had drowned herself for love,
not one of them remembered the name of the lover who
had gone away and left her.</p>


<p class="break">My Lady&rsquo;s most solicitous attendance was unable to cheer
the Admiral. He retired to bed in the most absolute
dejection. He seemed to be almost haunted by an idea
that his luck must have died with the death of the loving
Rusidda, and with him bodily infirmities always crept in
after ailings of the spirit. I was therefore almost terrified
by a most untoward event which happened in the morning.</p>

<p>His Majesty had risen very early, and as I noted that he
was gazing with intense anxiety at some distant object, I
hurried up to the chart-house and procured a glass for him.
The moment he put the spy-glass to his eye he turned
ghastly pale, and with an exclamation of horror let it fall,
clattering on the deck. It was fortunately not injured, and
I hastily picked it up and looked in the same direction; and
lo! away on our starboard quarter, with his face full upon
us, much swollen and discoloured by the water, and his
eyes started from their sockets by strangulation, floated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>409]</a></span>
ill-fated Caracciolo! All the superstition of the Italians
was called into play by this extraordinary and fearful
apparition. His hair&mdash;which, though it was dark when we
saw him that day at Pompeji, was turned quite grey with the
apprehensions of his last few days&mdash;streamed in the light
breeze that rippled the placid waters. I could see how
alarmed the King was: no one but an Italian or Portuguese
could have turned so deathly pale.</p>

<p>We had many priests on board; they had swarmed
round the King like flies round a pot of honey. I hunted
them up now, one after another; but none was of the smallest
consolation, till one, more adroit than his brothers, told
the King that the spirit of his unfortunate Admiral could
not rest without his forgiveness, which he had risen to
implore.</p>

<p>This the King was graciously pleased to accord, but
without a corresponding effect on the corpse, which was
head and shoulders above the water and was swimming (or
drifting before the wind) to Naples.</p>

<p>The occasion was a serious one. It would probably
have been small loss to his kingdom if Ferdinand the First
of the Two Sicilies had in a fit of horror plunged overboard
to seek relief in a watery grave; but he was much more
like to lose his kingdom over it than his kingdom was
to lose him, for if ever Caracciolo reached Naples in that
terrible position, which gave one the idea of a swimming
man, all our eighteen ships of the line might not have
been able to restrain the feelings of the populace.</p>

<p>There was therefore nothing for it but for me to waken
the Admiral, whom I had seen to bed in such sickness and
dejection, from his uneasy slumbers. In supreme moments
any man in the world who was near him must have
turned to that commanding spirit for strength.</p>

<p>But now I was more alarmed for the Admiral than for
the King. What would, I wondered, be the effect on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>410]</a></span>
mind, already overwrought by the terrible news of the
preceding evening, of this apparition of one upon whom
he had pronounced the death sentence found by the
Sicilian court-martial. However, there was nothing for it
but to fetch him.</p>

<p>He was so ill that he could hardly walk, and I was
in a cold sweat as to what would happen. I handed him
my glass to look at that upon which all eyes were
riveted, and to my joy I saw the blood and animation rush
back to his face, and that curious smile spread over it that
was there as we rode into the Nile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, he&mdash;that scoundrel?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Mr. Trinder,
ask the Captain to have her unmoored and to hoist sail,
and head the ship for him. We&rsquo;ll soon put him right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think every Italian in the ship expected him to be
struck dead, or a thunderbolt to fall from the clear sky,
and not a few of our chaps felt a bit queer over it; but up
went the anchors and aloft went the men, and we shook
out our sails and bent them, and very soon we were
bounding along towards the apparition.</p>

<p>How great a man I felt the Admiral to be at that moment!
as great as I felt him when we were running into the Nile
and Trafalgar, with the French blazing away at us, and
us reserving our guns double-shotted until we were near
enough for them to tear the whole length of the ships we
raked. To head the ship for it, our great <i>Foudroyant</i>, of
which we were so proud, made every man feel his courage;
while if the Admiral had ordered a boat to be lowered
it would have taken some stiff-backed men to go in her&mdash;though
he would, I have not the least doubt, have gone
himself. When we did get up to it, and backed our
topsails, no Englishman in the ship need have been put out
by it, for it was plain to every one that the body had risen
because it was so distended with gases, bred by some
horrible internal disease. And then we read the Sicilians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>411]</a></span>
a lesson of British courage and discipline. For when the
Admiral gave his orders, without the smallest unusual
bustle or excitement a boat was lowered, and the men took the
evil-looking and horrible-smelling thing on board&mdash;still, as
it proved, with those double-headed thirty-two pound shot
fastened to the feet&mdash;and rowed it a couple of miles, it might
have been, to a point on the shore, where they buried it at
their leisure.</p>

<p>And I do think that this should have laid the ghost of
Caracciolo as effectively among the Admiral&rsquo;s enemies in
England as it did among the superstitious Neapolitans,
who were veritably more impressed with this than by any
of his victories over the French.</p>

<p>Hardly had the <i>Foudroyant</i> returned to her moorings,
when we beheld the standards of England and the Sicilies
run up on the lofty Citadel of St. Elmo, and had it saluted
by one-and-twenty guns repeated from every vessel in the
fleet, as they noted the proud signal. And as soon as might
be after that, a barge dashed out from the Arsenal with
Captain Troubridge on board, to announce the surrender of
the Citadel, the last point in Naples to hold out against
the Sovereign, at a loss to us of only two killed and five
wounded, though the Swiss and Russians and Albanians
and Calabrians suffered somewhat more severely, owing to
a sortie which they had successfully countered.</p>

<p>So interested was every one in the new hero of the hour&mdash;the
splendid British seaman who had no equal, but the
Admiral, where tough fighting was to be done&mdash;that nobody
noticed a second barge which pulled alongside shortly after
the other, starting from the Castel dell&rsquo; Uovo, and which, as
it proved, contained, besides Will and its crew, a lady and
a lame old gentleman. But that was the first time that
Katherine saw the Admiral, to whom her gracious presence
was to be the one bright star during the wearisome weeks
that he had to be at Deal, to watch some new move of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>412]</a></span>
flotilla which Napoleon had assembled at Boulogne for the
invasion of England; and the first time that my Lord
Eastry, the greatest of all the frigate captains before
Cochrane, and the great Lord Nelson were face to face.</p>


<p class="break">This brings me back to the Admiral&mdash;the Admiral about
whom I sat down to write this chronicle, but whom I had
almost forgotten for the moment, for Will is so much the
nearer to me.</p>

<p>Well, the Admiral lived for more than six years after
this. And though his friends made moan over his ill-health
and ill-spirits, and that great love of his for which alone he
had the wish and the spirit to live, whatever the sin or the
shame of it might have been; and, though his enemies at
home found him neglectful, and insubordinate, and whatnot,
he went from strength to strength, and as the necessity
became the greater, he put forth fresh powers of his
genius. It was his very name which preserved England
from invasion during the long months that Napoleon lay
at Boulogne. He had the Danish Navy at Copenhagen, and
would have had the Russian into the bargain if his blockheads
of superiors had let him. And, as all the world
knows, at the sad and glorious day of Trafalgar he swept
the seas.</p>

<p>And so to rest, in the heart of the Cathedral, which is the
heart of the City, which is the heart of the Empire, which
was the creation of him, who made all the seas the highways
of the King of England.</p>

<p class="bookblarge">&ldquo;MORE OR LESS MARRIED.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Douglas Sladen&rsquo;s first novel is a distinct success. He has been
exceptionally fortunate in his <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>. He wanted to write a
Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister novel. In itself, one can hardly imagine a more
unpromising subject; and I confess I took up the book with the gravest
misgivings. But they were soon dissipated. For what does Mr.
Sladen do but transplant that familiar British grievance to Japan, of all
places in the world, and introduce us to European Yokohama society,
which has never yet been exhausted from the novelist&rsquo;s standpoint! On
this virgin soil he has planted two heroines&mdash;sisters&mdash;both delightful,
and both sympathetic. Most writers would have made their hero
marry the wrong sister first; but Mr. Sladen, more wisely, makes him
marry the right one&mdash;the one he loves, the one who loves him&mdash;while
yet keeping the reader&rsquo;s interest mainly engaged on the one he doesn&rsquo;t
marry. This is excellently managed. Again, the novelty of the local
colour and the brightness of the story make us forget the familiarity of
the annual and perennial grievance on which it hinges. In due time
the first wife dies at an excellent juncture, and Phil Sandys, the hero,
does not marry her sister Bryn, the delicious heroine. On the contrary,
to prevent scandal, he sends her home to the England she has never
seen, consigned to the care of a most unpleasant rector cousin. All
the circumstances conspire to produce a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. You foresee but
one end&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t happen. A steamer to Melbourne, where such
marriages are legal, and a short way out of the trouble? Nothing
of the sort: Mr. Sladen takes a bolder and more dangerous course.
Bryn&rsquo;s objection to a marriage with Phil is a strictly ecclesiastical one&mdash;the
Church forbids: but the objection goes down before a sufficient
cause like a Japanese house before a gentle earthquake. How Phil and
Bryn substituted a union blessed by the American Minister to Japan
and the whole resident Christian population for a strictly legal ceremony
must be read in the novel itself. Certainly, the story as a whole
succeeds in interesting and amusing the most jaded reader; it is wholesome,
healthful, breezy, and airy. Its Japanesquery is delightful; and
its ethics will only disturb the peace of the Anglican clergy, while
deepening in the minds of not a few among the laity the sense of
opposition to a bishop-made restriction, which prevents the legal union
of two people so obviously designed for one another as its hero and
heroine.&mdash;G.&nbsp;A.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="centerpad"><b>NEW STORY by the Author of that successful Novel<br />
&ldquo;A WELSH SINGER.&rdquo;</b></p>

<p class="booklarge">TORN SAILS.</p>

<p class="center">A TALE OF A WELSH VILLAGE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ALLEN RAINE.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In cloth gilt</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;In his new story, &lsquo;Torn Sails,&rsquo; Mr. Allen Raine fully maintains
and strengthens the position as a novelist which his &lsquo;Welsh Singer&rsquo;
indicated for him. It is a tender and beautiful romance of the
idyllic; a charming picture of life in a Welsh seaside village. It is
something of a prose poem, true, tender, and graceful. It is also a
charming picture of an interesting and by no means familiar scene of
life and manners, in which the humorous traits, though, are rich
enough to enliven and brighten the whole.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Scotsman.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;The expectations aroused by &lsquo;A Welsh Singer&rsquo; have not been
disappointed by Mr. Raine&rsquo;s latest work, which is surpassingly
beautiful. The absorbing interest of the whole story is the strongest
tribute to the author&rsquo;s power of characterisation.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>N.B. Daily
Mail.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely pictures are given here and there in the book. No recent
novel has a more graceful influence and promised greater things for
its author&rsquo;s future. Wales should be proud of her new novelist.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Dundee
Advertiser.</b></p>

<p class="booklarge">A WELSH SINGER.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ALLEN RAINE.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In cloth gilt</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly idyllic; well conceived, true to life, and worked out in a
dainty spirit. Allen Raine has produced a very charming and
delicate story.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Athen&aelig;um.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wales has waited long for her novelist; but he seems to have
come at last in the person of Mr. Allen Raine, who, in his perfectly
beautiful story, &lsquo;A Welsh Singer,&rsquo; has at once proved himself a
worthy interpreter and exponent of the romantic spirit of his
country.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Daily Mail.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are in the mood for a novel, I can recommend to you
strongly a really charming pastoral, &lsquo;A Welsh Singer.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Truth.</b></p>
